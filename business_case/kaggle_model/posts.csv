I was watching A Quiet Place when the civil defence alert happened. Nearly had a damn heart attack
" Fighting covid is like fighting a fire

You respond the moment there is a small blaze

You don’t wait till it becomes a raging inferno then spray some water on it and say “um why isn’t this working”"
U/kezzaNZ I really appreciated your prompt undates with lockdown and cant stress enough how much you have helped with good prompt consistent info. Thank you
*^(hello darkness my old friend)*
"Aw man, I work at a major supermarket distribution centre and I feel like I had only just fully recovered from working consecutive 52+ hours a week when the country was in level 3-4. PLEASE, for the sake of my mental and physical health, please do not panic buy!"
"This is the new normal. It happened in Brisbane too. Big scare, some infections but quick action by the very extensive Queensland health infrastructure has meant 0 case days have returned."
F in the comments for those in bed when the mobile alert came.
"Ha, that emergency alert just scared the bajeezus of me"
"Kezza mate, I love ya but was hoping to not hear from you again."
Holy shit level 3 for Auckland. She's not fucking around.
"I currently have a cold, should I now get tested?"
"God damn it I was already gonna go buy lots of bread and toilet paper tomorrow people gonna think I'm a panic buyer :( I just get paid fortnightly!

Edit: I'm not in Auckland so I should be fine sorry to everyone who is in a similar situation up there those panic buys suck! Kia kaha New Zealand."
"On the bright side....

Daily 1pm Dr Bloomfield?"
No free Chicken McNuggets tomorrow I guess
"On a positive note, this time i enter lockdown a true master of sourdough. Prepare for artisan bread NZ."
"Should be quick'n'easy to trace everyone since we all been scanning them barcodes, right fellas?

.

.

.

fellas ?"
"From an Aussie who lived in New Zealand for 6 years - and now living in Melbourne. Going back into lock down sucks, and is harder than going into it the first time. Look after yourself. It seems like it is endless, but it won't be. Kia kaha."
"Just wanted to say to all of you that you made this easier to get through, last time. Keep it up. We will do it again, together."
"Oh shit, here we go again."
As someone who works in the live event industry in Auckland i was just getting back into doing gigs again. This is absolutely crushing.
"People in my family have had all the symptoms and was the most sick they've ever been but won't get tested to see if they had it or still have it. Who do I contact to refer their names for contact tracing? They got tested for it before getting sick and had the all clear and since that they don't want to get ""confirmed sick"" I guess. Family can be frustrating."
"get the covid tracer app people. it's easy as fuck to use, even my nana could do it.

takes no time to set the time and date of places you went. 

it could save lives, and it gets us out of this faster"
"How else could it get into the community other than via a border worker?

Someone who had an extremely delayed onset of the virus? Someone who fluked multiple false negatives and showed no symptoms?"
"Just want to say kudos to the family who got tested. Regardless of the bad news, they did the right thing. No stigma for getting sick.

If you have symptoms, get tested. We only beat this thing if we help each other by being vigilant."
"Sucks for my brother and family in Melbourne.

I just put a kiwi treat package together for him. Now it's mine."
"I read the comments on the livestream. 

I'm measurably dumber now."
Three out of six is really rough. I hope that family pulls through this alright.
"Panic Buying already in Auckland
 Some Supemarkets have closed their doors at 10pm as they don't have enough night staff on to cope.

Have we not learned anything from last time

THERE IS NO NEED TO PANIC BUY!"
"Kiwi in Queensland here.


We were in a similar boat a couple of weeks ago when we had our first community transmission since May.
We were pissed off (beyond pissed off) and very, very anxious. But so many Queenslanders did the right thing and came forward and got tested, our contact tracers and lab techs (among many many others) worked like absolute trojans and, touch wood, it appears we may have dodged a bullet.


Thinking of you all, and hoping that you’ll get on top of it quickly and return to normal ASAP ❤️"
"Any time a post hits all:

*Americans*: “Is... is this about me now?”"
Does day drinking become acceptable again?
"Back again bois, let's show the world how it's done!

Edit: Thank you for my first award you awesome laser Kiwi!!!!"
David Clark can bike wherever he likes this time.
"If this goes longer than three days I swear I’m sticking to this kettlebell workout throughout, not like last time."
"Had a major sinking feeling reading this. As much as it was annoying to see New Zealanders living free, it was a genuine beacon of hope/goal for us stuck in the lockdown states in Australia that you guys could eliminate it. Seriously hope you get a handle on this - looks like there's no wasting time with the immediate lockdown though which seems to be a real positive of your governance."
So are we going back to daily Sir Ashley shows and Kezza reports?
[deleted]
"As an Australian the fact NZ has this well thought out resurgence plan makes it a million times better than Australia.

This is entirely a good thing.

By reacting Hard and reacting fast, NZ can quickly go back to hopefully no community transmission and being the star of the world when it comes to covid cases.

As an Australian who has been socially distancing, wearing a mask and generally acting like I could have Covid and doing my best not to expose myself or expose others, watching waiting for the chance to go out and do stuff like get hair done etc in good conscience is a bitch and I wish we had the decisiveness of the NZ Gov instead of half assing stuff."
My grandma died an hour ago. She lived in Auckland. I can't got to the funeral anymore.
"Jesus i thought it was gonna be CHCH.

Edit. That aged well."
"hopefully the MoH can trace this to its origin, I'm really interested to know how it slipped through"
I was meant to start a new job tomorrow here in Auckland after not working for 6 months hahaha fml
"Feeling for everyone in Auckland right now. Honestly, what I’m worried about more than catching the COVID itself is the panic buying..."
"That ""Presidential Alert"" just now felt oddly apocalyptic"
"Its hard, it sucks. But we did it before, we can do it again."
New World + Countdown + PakNSave websites all crashed/bung.
Goodbye Cook Islands travel bubble
"Missed you u/kezzaNZ but please, not like this"
"Last time, we had at least a full cruise ship of people spreading it, and cases all around the country. 1500ish cases and 22 deaths.

Stay home where appropriate. Wear your god damned mask.

We'll be fine."
Was hoping I’d never see you on the front page again :(
We leave managed isolation tomorrow. We were looking forward to re-joining a COVID free country....fucking fuck.
"Kia kaha, Aucklanders. Sending good vibes from Welly."
"Kia Kaha from Melbourne. Second time around hits harder, so stay safe, be kind to yourself and we'll all be sharing stories in the years to come ☺️."
"Was bound to happen. If we can get this outbreak under control very quickly, we can get back to normal ASAP. We still have a fuck load of absolute morons though I see. Supermarkets flooded by them. They learnt nothing from the last time. I guess that’s why they’re morons."
Guys fucking chill and stop swearing about the government being shit. Dr bloomefield said that this was inevitable. We have plans in place and we should sort this out.
Days without incident : 0
[deleted]
Oh for fucks sake. Here we go again
"Logical response.
I'll be making sure my important jobs are done asap incase we need another nationwide lockdown."
Now watch as idiots start to panic buy flour and pasta.
My fiancé lives in Auckland. She called me with the news and I’ve never felt so helpless. Really hoping everything gets under control soon. Wishing everyone in Auckland the best.
I got paid tonight and was so excited for a bakery lunch tomorrow at work... haven't had a pie in ages... oh well. Let's all do this together again.
New Zealand gonna school the rest of the world back to back on pandemic control the response is so quick and thought out can’t be more jealous
"Idk about you guys but I'm pretty keen to get in on mask fashion now. Silver linings and all that.

P.S. we at the supermarkets had finally started a return to normal trading patterns. Please don't rush out over the next few days. It's way easier to keep everything that you want on the shelves when you're not crowding the stores unnecessarily."
If only this response happened in melbourne 6 weeks ago
Any fellow Kiwi's here watching Americans fight over our response lol
"Ah, fuck. Here we go again"
Large lines forming at the 24-hour Countdowns across Auckland. :/
There's apparently lines of people at the supermarkets again with staff having to turn away customers. What are the odds we'll get another 'toilet paper shortage'?
"Reminder since it's been a while: **No gatherings** are allowed **at all**. No 10 people limit, no nothing. NO GATHERINGS.

(Except for funerals and weddings, but that doesn't apply to most.)

Please upvote if you also mis-remembered this rule. A lot of people are confused because of the temporary 10 person limit when we shifted down to level 2.

Edit: this is for Auckland. The rest of you are fine."
I forgot the difference between level 1 and 2. It's just social distancing again and limited capacity in bars and restaurants etc.?
"Finding the tone and content of a lot of FB commented about this pretty worrying. Seems to be a lot of people who don't want to accept this and even worse people peddling conspiracies about it. 

I can see things going badly this time."
Close the South Island borders
"Well it's only for 3 days which is fine but if this results in another stint in level 4 I'll be pissed. Please be a one off for crying out loud... 

Fuck you CoViD. Fuck you hard.

Edit: Work is going to be extra awesome tommorow. Can't wait to get it up the arse from customers because we're essentially shutting down from 12. GOOD LUCK TEEEEEEAM."
I can just imagine National is gonna have a field day with this and probably come out with ‘We would have handled this better’.
"So, I think this is a great time to announce my new business venture: a ferry from Tauranga to Whangarei..."
 Billy Te Kahika and his moron Public Party have announced nationwide anti-lockdown protests tomorrown and warned people that Antifa will be there to cause them trouble. What a fuckknuckle.
This thread is a fucking dumpster fire. It's as if a bunch of Americans have been waiting for this post so they can shit on people.
Doing a nightshift in NZ tonight and all these international comments are a bit of a yikes.
I finally got the alert 🎉🎈
"As freaked as I am, it feels like the steps the government are putting in place are the right ones."
The whole “100 days of no community transmission” celebrations really did not age well
Bought my laptop home from work today... so lucky lmao
Does anyone know what happens during level 3 and 4 for child visits? Partner and I split up after the last lockdown. Can i still go over to visit as usual?
I guess this means Gabe's party will be canceled...
"Ah shit, here we go again."
"Fucking idiots in these comments. Anyone commenting ""get rekt"" or similar is missing the magnitude of what it's going on here and is a part of the problem. I'm so sick of people in the US thinking that they're the only relevant people on the planet and that their ""freedoms"" and memes are more important than literal human lives. Fuck these people."
"You guys have got this, best of luck."
This is fucked. Its kinda insane that airport and quarantine hotel staff were not being tested regularly despite being potentially in contact with infection on the regular. Tests taken voluntarily upon presenting with symptoms by which point opportunity for spread is plenty. Especially with asymptotic incubation.
I haven't missed the press asking the same question 100 times over.
"Glad I had already placed my pick up order for groceries earlier this evening. Hopefully it isn't all out of stock by the time it gets packed
Looks like people are already panic buying 😒"
"All the best to you guys from Melbourne, Australia. You guys are doing the right thing taking this seriously. Might feel like an overreaction but that's the way it goes with this virus. You can't ignore it or be wishful. You got to go hard.   


Hope to visit your beautiful country with my family when this is over."
"Well fuck. I fully expect Auckland to be in L4 on the weekend and the rest of the country to be in L3, depending on the border testing and the ChCh homes results. 

Really doubtful it was 100+ days of asymptomatic transmission so in my humble uneducated opinion, this has to have been from the border, right?"
Looks like COVID's back on the menu boys
Kia kaha team we can beat COVID again.
Oh my. I think the worst part is the god damn panic buyers. It's already begun. The super markets are still going to be open for God sake. Use your brains. It's only for 3 days at this stage. WOW.
"We beat it once, we'll beat it again.

Be smart NZ. We've got this."
"It's sad to hear about new Covid cases in the country, and it's hard to go back into the alert levels - particularly hard for people in Auckland on Alert Level 3. But we've done this once; we can do it again. Kia kaha, everyone.

I have seen complaints already that we are overreacting to ""just four cases"". This is a virus that spreads exponentially. If we saw four cases now and didn't take action, there could be hundreds or thousands in a few weeks. I think that this is, once again, the right call.

Political sidebar: It was frustrating to see the leader of the Opposition lashing out at the government before midnight. Over the last few months, National have continually stated we should be be following the models of countries such as Sweden and Australia, but those countries have not been as successful as New Zealand in dealing with Covid-19; if National were in power and had followed through on their rhetoric, we would never have been out of the first lockdown. We would have been just another country with an increasing proportion of the population dead from Covid, and ongoing and widespread community transfer. It seems quite apparent the best country's policy we could follow is our own.

National: Why strive to be your best when you could aim for average?"
Be interesting to see the testing numbers in the upcoming days.
"Is their plan to test basically every employee who works nearly every employee in the managed isolation system? Including airport staff, police and immigration officers, bus drivers.

Hopefully find the leak in 3 days? And isolate everyone from then.  

3 days doesnt seem long enough.  They could be prepared for a level 4 announcement on saturday"
"Oh thank fucking god, I had a 25% test for uni tomorrow. I’m reasonably prepared, but fuck, I’m down for extra study time."
"I'm just reading about this and you've already posted all the details half an hour ago? How in the fuck are you so quick?

Also fuck, this sucks. :("
Pretty depressing to hear there is already a run in the supermarkets.
"Paul Henry comes back to NZ, then this. Pfffttt."
"Stink.. but not 100% unexpected.  


If you read ANY of the papers on this, then they all said there was a chance of it slipping throu.. and it could be a LARGE number of ways."
"Just what I wanted... to give birth in lockdown 😑  thanks Auckland, very cool"
"I live next to a liquor store in a uni accommodation area and heaps of people are running here to stock up lmao

Edit: there's a like a big line now"
"We’ve done this before. It sucks, and I’ve got some personal situations going on this time (my dad is currently visiting without any way to get home now), but I feel better about it than I did in March. We survived a couple months in lockdown, and who knows? Maybe they’ll find the link and things will be back to normal in a week. Kia kaha everyone"
"Just finishing my shift at the grocery store, and the panic buyers arrived before I even heard the news. Sucks to be them, store closes at 11."
Anyone want to wager on how many spam emails I get from businesses tomorrow using the level change as an excuse to get some sneaky advertising in?
"This is like the equivalent of that one kid at school who says they did terribly on the test because they only got 100% and missed the extra credit question, while you’re sitting there with a 17%"
Level 3 for Auckland. Good. No faffing about.
"We need a level system associated with our alert system.
  
Level 1: Sends an alert to your phone and sounds an alarm to wake you up if you're asleep to warn of imminent danger. I.E: Earthquake, Tsunami, under attack, etc.
  
Level 2: Sends an alert to your phone in the form of a txt message so that if you're asleep you can wake up fully rested and be informed about what's going on. I.E: COVID-19 updates.
 
EDIT: Misspelled COVID-19."
"As a Canadian that works in the United States Healthcare system I have to applaud the measures that the New Zealand government, its population, and the City of Auckland are doing to hammer down any chance of resurgence. 

I live in Ontario a province that is in my own opinion handling the outbreak very well, I travel to Michigan State an area that experienced a coronavirus peak in March. The way both areas are handling the steady trickle of daily infections seems lazy by comparison.

I'm thoroughly convinced that if we ever go to zero cases suggesting a lockdown over a single cluster would be political suicide. So I absolutely applaud the extreme measures, our Hospital barely survived our covid-19 peak intervention, it is not an experience I wish on any Healthcare facility."
"Pauline on ZB - 'We'll be in lockdown forever because of this bloody government!!!'

Why am I listening to this"
All face to face learning at Otago uni cancelled for tomrrow.
"Bit of confusion whether we can work in construction, when we were allowed to last time."
"Kezza strikes again, just as we need him most. Thanks mate."
Who turned 5G back on in South Auckland?
"Best of luck to you all in NZ! Hope it doesn’t get it out of hand, stay safe!"
"Please treat this as proper Level 3 - i.e. almost lockdown. When we transitioned to Level 3 from 4, people definitely started bending the rules more and were more complacent. We need to do this properly to avoid a Victoria situation."
"This is the kind of policy that actually makes a difference and it's why New Zealand has been so successful containing the virus. 

New Zealand: ""Four confirmed cases? Let's take action before things get worse."" 

United States: ""160,000 dead? Well, it's not the end of the world."""
"Be precautious. Don't feel weird about putting on a mask, it's better to be safe."
[deleted]
"I don't really understand all those who are commenting on Facebook or here hating on Jacinda, and saying that she ruined our country/economy or whatever? Like what opposed to lockdown, we let everyone run free, get infected and die? So what - would we rather be like USA and Australia?"
Well fuck. Currently on holiday in taupo and was flying out of auckland back to queenstown in a couple of days. Been on hold with air nz for 45 mins and counting to try to sort something else out.
"man this is really gonna put a damper on the ""100 days since community transmission"" threads that were all over reddit.

Bit scary that the guy has no history of overseas travel. Hope they can figure out where it came from quickly."
"As an Aucklander, holy fuck. Maybe I was naive but did not see this coming"
"Countdown online shopping is down and the whole New World website is down. Dumb bastards.

Edit: Up and down lol"
Damn kezza be getting mad karma for this one
"Still, to go 100 days without a community transmission, that's a impressive feat! If NZ can do it before, they can do it again!"
#TeamOfFiveMillion
"Also, big fucking props to the Family for getting tested."
Thanks for the 7am wake up real fucking cool guys
And there goes the civil defence alert....
Where do we buy reusable masks? All the places I've looked are sold out
"NZ situation is oddly similar to Vietnam, one was 102 days, another 99 Covid free. The patients did not have travel history or close approximation to infected source. Vietnam couldnt find F0 ( suspect it was Illegal migrants from China) for this 2nd wave and it spread really fast. I hope NZ could stop it before the spread. The mentality and morale the 2nd time got hit hard in Vietnam."
Oh so THAT'S what a plan looks like...
"As a person who's been quarantined for about 150 days I'd say I just wish I lived in a fucking country that gave a fuck about the virus. Like NZ. Legit every country should learn from NZ.

I love you my Kiwi friends! Mad respect."
It'll be interesting if they can figure out where the individuals got the virus from.
"Kia Kaha guys, much love from across the ditch 💕"
"Not looking forward to Collins going hard to undermine this

Edit: surprise, surprise: https://twitter.com/Jasonwalls92/status/1293135794018717703"
"Already seeing conspiracy chatter in my FB feed. Coming after the warnings about the inevitability of this event, and the warnings to have masks on hand, and to be ready to return to lockdown if necessary, the unhinged among us are going to join the dots and draw any fucking absurd conclusions they can cook up besides from ""this was always a possibility, we were warned it was possible, and we got unlucky"". I hope like hell that this doesn't catch on and turn into a local branch of the pandemic denialism that is literally leading people to their deaths overseas."
Mike Hosking just came in his pants
"Shit fuck, I just arranged an interview on Friday as well..."
Last time I had enough warning to stock up on liquor... This time they announced it after all the stores closed. This one is going to be rough.
"Wishing you the best from Vietnam. We thought we got it under control and BAM, 20 dead in a week and the whole country is preparing to go in lockdown again. Fuck 2020."
It was a damn fine 100 days!
[deleted]
Cool i had a cold last week. Better go get a test.
Fml back to day drinking in my pjs
BUT ANIMAL CROSSING IS BORING THIS TIME AROUND
"Well, fuck.

Worst week and a half of work I've had for a looong time, and now we've returned to the Covid shitshow.

Honestly, working from home again might be good for me to recharge after being completely wrecked from the past few weeks of work fuckery."
So 3 days at level 3 before auckland moves to level 4?
"Fuck guys, I feel for you.   Be strong, be smart.   I’m stuck in Japan and have worn a face mask in public (and opening the door to delivery people) everyday since early Feb on the few occasions I venture out into the unknown.   It sucks at first but you’ll soon get used to it.  Just do it, it’s for you as much as it is for others and that’s where the Kiwi spirit of community wins."
"Wild. Four cases and you go into lockdown.

I'm over here in Germany and the caseload is rising into the thousands per day and the government is moving real slow. I'm glad your government has its priorities straight."
"I'm in Coro, can I enter Auckland after 12? I live there"
Thanks for the 6:55am alert really appreciate it
[deleted]
Fuck fuck fuck
Stiiiink.
"So, to confirm, unless extended the country excl. Auckand is level two until midnight Friday?

Edit: I am asking about the country not including Auckland which is stated to go into level two"
"From Melbourne so I know what you're going through, kia kaha NZ bros ❤️"
Fuck
"Melburnian here, I hope you guys get a hold of this as fast as possible."
Fucks sake. I blame those guys who broke out of quarantine for a funeral now that I'm stuck in Level 3.
"Hate you covid. 
We can do this again team. 5 million."
Reeeeeally not looking forward to Q shitheads/Americans in general online getting smug over this
"We crushed it once, we'll crush it again."
TF are all these Americans doing here?
"And the Media kept saying Ashley Bloomfield was fear mongering, that a second wave was inevitable."
"We can do it, nz! Team of 5 million. We can do it. Kia kaha"
"Geez, New Zealand ain't messing about. I wonder what it feels like to have a functional government taking adequate measures.."
how the fuck are you so quick at this
I guess this means Gabe Newells concert is canceled.
Good luck from Canada!
I'm seriously impressed by how swiftly and professionally this was handled. The rest of the world needs to look to NZ for how to handle this thing.
I didn’t want to sleep tonight anyway.
Season 2 of kezza's 1pm updates incoming? :c
ITT: a bunch of Americans trying to justify 150.000+ deaths due to inept leadership.
ruh-roh
"So, if there's more cases Aucks goes into level 4, rest of us stay in L2?"
"I’m gonna need a refresher on what the levels mean, it’s been a while"
Does this mean schools will shut?
Ugh the most worrying thing is they said two of the infected work at separate work places in Auckland. If we are unlucky it could be well out there by now
"This is gonna be harder than the first time mentally definitely. I knew it was probably coming but it definitely sucks. It's also just another example of how hard this virus is to keep out, pretty much every country has had a second wave"
"Got the news from a doctor relative. Their clinic will be doing a lot more swabs. Anyone in Akl, especially South Akl should probably get tested"
"If over the next few days there turns out to be no covid in the south island, then we had better be downgraded to level 1 and travel from the north island  restricted."
"Sorry NZ, but thankfully you’re not in stage IV again! 

*Cries in Melbourne*"
Now watch Mike Hosking flip his argument again
"Got tested last week because I had a little sniffle and a liiittle bit of a sore throat. Please get tested if you feel even the slightest bit sick guys, it only took me about half an hour and the peace of mind for you and your loved ones is worth it!!"
"Have National put out a statement blaming the government for slack border control yet?

I'm sure Gerry will be front and centre  saying "" I told you they were hiding something"""
Shit I was in Auckland last weekend. Apologies in advance if I just brought it to Christchurch.
"Tools down boys, Auckland is back to Level 3. What a nightmare."
"“Ah you think the bubble is your ally? You merely adopted the bubble. I was born in it, molded by it."""
"I have to teach online from Thursday. Back to heaps of students not having laptops. If it's extended by much, NCEA for 2020 is truly fucked."
"Can we all collectively chant ""Fuck you covid"" from our windows tomorrow night?"
This is going to keep happening every few months unless they do something drastic about the way people and cargo enter the country.
So what level are we heading back to?
I feel sick to my stomach
u/opticalminefield time for another graph. :)
[deleted]
Bugger
You detailed level 3 but not 2. I forgot what level 2 entails
"The people listening to Magic Talk are furious, probably the same on ZB."
"With the no travel in and out of Auckland, does anyone know if that's from 12pm onwards tomorrow? Trying to find out but haven't had much luck. I'm currently on holiday out of the city but wondering if it's worth cutting it short to get back home."
After 100 days we are back :(
"Reading the responses from NZ brethren here makes me realize how acclimated I’ve become to the situation in the US (note I said acclimated- not accepting re shitshow national leadership). Certain I’m not the only expat having that experience. Anyhoo - you got this Aotearoa! Calm down on the panic loo rolls, stop mobbing the bloody Countdown, wear your masks, and be good to each other. You’re gonna be ok. Arohanui."
Damn you guys are on the fucking ball. Makes me wish I lived in a real 1st-world country.
Kia Kaha Aotearoa
"Why are they waiting until tomorrow lunchtime to lock Auckland now?

Surely after watching people overseas rush between towns to beat lockdowns and spread it, it would be better to lockdown asap..."
This thread really is baiting out a lot of fucking idiots from overseas. Mods got their work cut out for them today.
"It's bad news, but we smashed it once, we'll smash it again."
"Hi from Melbourne, my heart sank when I heard the news. Whole nation is feeling for our Kiwi brothers & sisters."
"""Looks like level 2's back on the menu boys!"""
"Do it right NZ, do it once (more)."
All the Yanks are turning up now. Where's the border control and quarantine for this thread?
Fuck.
"Well hopefully the national contact tracing app makes it easy and reliable to track where they've been....

*chuckles nervously*"
There are so many conspiracy theorists in the livestream comments it really makes my blood boil!!
Good luck New Zealand!! Y’all got this.
"Fuck. Gutted but trying to tell myself we've prepared for this. We knew it was only a matter of time, we're in a much better place now both economically and having learned more about the virus and how it works. still - FUCK!"
Kia kaha Auckland.
"Sinking feeling in the stomach. We've been through this before, we can do it again. It'll be tough getting out of bed tomorrow though."
Dont be bringing that shit down to Hamilton please
Welp there goes birthday plans
Leo Molloy will be holding a 101 person pissup party with the Tamaki's within hours.
kezzaaaaaa
"Living in London, I'm gutted to hear about this. You stamped the fucker out once, you can do it again. Trust in the steady head of Dr Bloomfield."
I hope the road blocks work.  It would be infuriating if it were to spread outside of Auckland (assuming that it not present outside of Auckland).
This should serve as a reminder that just because there or zero cases does not mean that the virus went away. Its not possible to test everyone so there are going to be individuals passing it around.
This is some pure pandemic response porn.  As an American I’m quite jealous.
American here wish you the best of luck. Reassuring to see your government is interested in finding the truth. Our president just complains about all the testing they’re doing. Wish he could the same mentality taken here. Would have been a lot better for us.
"You’ve got this, NZ. You absolutely crushed it the first time and I know it’s tough, but you can crush it again. 

The remaining healthy parts of Australia are cheering you on. Kia kaha <3"
Let’s do this
See... This is how you handle an outbreak. Imagine if the US had done this back when we had our first cases.
Damn the plague inc. player started a fungal type disease.
So this is what the response from a competent government looks like. Mind sharing notes with the US?
💩
The rise of KezzaNZ
"Sucks to see you posting again Kezza


(If you know what I mean)"
I guess this shows that we have to be vigilant about testing even when the country's been clean for a while
Damn. I walked past the isolation hotel today with the positive case as he was getting in the jetpark van and it shocked me enough to start preparing for another lockdown. Didn’t think itd be today
Hopefully we get this managed straight away.
Do we know where in Auckland the family is from? I mean regardless we've gotta all behave but there's a lot less concern about going to the supermarket when you inevitably have to in South Auckland if the outbreak is on the north shore and vice versa.
Gutted
Americans ITT laughing at the 4 cases in a country that previously had none

"As an American, I respect New Zealand and its people.

They united and worked together to manage COVID-19. They viewed this from start to finish as a humanitarian issue and not a political issue.  They were more than willing to do whatever was necessary to resolve this.  And now that a single fringe incident has occurred, they are not making up excuses or trying to pretend they can ignore this, without skipping a beat and without hesitation, they are going to unite again and kick COVID-19's ass.

America could learn to be more human by learning from New Zealand."
Fuck.
I assume Auckland will go to level 2 after level 3 ends?

You all have got this. I wish I could say the same of the US (my country). 1000+ deaths a day and our leader says “It is what it is”....
"I was going to make another snide comment about the stupidity of the American response, but this is a fantastic example of what a top-down leadership with a rigorous plan of action looks like.  There is no need to parody the U.S. response.  It is a parody of itself.

I feel more vested in seeing NZ kick the virus' ass again than listening to the simpleton in the Oval Office.  I have hope for NZ.  I have no hope for the U.S."

Is this what it's like to have a competent government? I'm envious. They are treating COVID like a public health issue and not politicizing it. I'm just amazed.
welp. i only went back to work from the lockdown a month and a half ago🤦‍♂️

I'm begging you americans to leave this thread alone we're trying to sleep
The honesty from NZ is Huge here .. it’s hardly any cases . Easily could have been ignored. Good on ya
Planned and paid for my sons first birthday in Hamilton this weekend. Currently living in gisborne. Family is all up there. Hearing people break their isolation / quarantine over this period really fucks me off. “Oh but I need my chicken nuggets or popcorn chicken” absolute rubbish. New Zealand brushes this shit off their shoulders because “nothing happens to us as a country”. I’ve seen many people post this. What a disgrace.
Disappointed that there isn't a mandatory mask requirement.
"Just got another warning sent to my phone. Sounds like the start of the purge, It's not even 7am yet"
"They did tell us to expect this, and it’s heartening to know they’re prepared and acting swiftly once again. Serious testing going on, as it should be!"
Oh no does this mean Blues Crusaders is off? suuuuucks.
"Lmao. Part of NZ going on a total lockdown over 4 cases, meanwhile here in America we have a thousand deaths a day... I hate my government...."
"Take a shot everytime *someone* says:

"Mount Albert Primary school just sent out a letter saying one of the children at the school is from a household that has tested positive for COVID. Child has been tested but no results yet.

"As an American, I just want to say that after seeing the strict plan as well as the support from all the comments on here about making sure everyone is testing and not complaining about going back in lockdown, that my country is screwed.  Hope this is a single incident for you and pray we can get some leadership here to get it contained."

"I visited Auckland in the weekend stayed with friends and went into town (sky tower, mall, tourist things) what should i be doing?"
"Is wearing masks recommended for those of us living outside of Auckland? I’ll probably be wearing one regardless of recommendation, just curious."

But at what cost?"
Can someone please remind me of the travel rules during level 2?
Ughh.. Not again!
"Ah, crap."
What if you fly out from Auckland to go home? Can you still go to Auckland?
Fuck me. Just got home from setting up work for level 3 (IT) and now I have to sleep for 3 hours to wake up at 6 to make sure the universe doesn't implode. Fun times. Thanks Corona Virus.

Can I go paddleboarding?
It's a Tuesday night should I go to the pub now
Fuck no NO NO NOOOO
Are takeaways open at level 3?
We've had a box of masks sitting in our kitchen since level 4.of course now that we need them we somehow can't find them
"So what is likely to happen after Friday? Would we either go to level 2 or 4, or stay at 3? I don’t suppose we’d go back to level 1? Will it depend on how the contact tracing goes?

Serious question haha, the levels and timings slightly confuse me."

Can someone please explain to me how a country can possibly get another case of this when it's had no cases for over 100 days and the person never left the country?  This thing literally lies dormant for that Long? This is surely some extremely quickly mutating stuff to cause something like this

That was quick
"Here in the UK the Govt is like: ""Go out Monday - Wednesday to restaurants, but wear a mask. Also, next month we want all offices back up and running again with no plans on staggering it"".. 

Pathetic response here. I get the need for the economy to bounce back but they're almost waving the white flag. 

My employer is planning on everyone back 1 September, and i've heard a lot of others are doing the same. Tubes will be packed again and a lot of people even on the tube don't wear masks. If I wasn't earning twice what I would make in NZ it would be tempting to go back, but then I would just be part of the problem and could potentially pick it up at the airport / bring it back to an isoltaion facility."

">you must work from home unless you’re an essential service worker

That isn’t entirely true. It states you must work from home unless that is not possible. Businesses can open premises, but cannot physically interact with customers"
Ok I'm going to take a guess and say that this might be a case of asymptomatic transmission.

"Scary times considering it's flu season. I've been sick the past week with Covid/flu symptoms and I put it down to just being the flu which has been doing the rounds in my city (not Auckland). Now I know there's community transmission - who knows who could have it and be passing it around?

Edit: yes I know about testing but it's a lot harder to find testing areas since going to level 1. Instead of driving around in a poorly state trying to find a test station I've opted to stay home and away from other people. My doctor wasn't too bothered with my symptoms either on the phone so I figured it was fine to stay home - which is the recommendation unless you're really ill."

"This massive reaction to a single digit number of cases is what we need everywhere. We would have less lockdowns overall if we did it like that. ""Flattening the curve"" is difficult and costly like keeping a forest fire from getting too large while not attempting to extinguish it"
This reminds me of the case study where an asymptomatic American women traveled to China and it resulted in a super cluster which infected > 70 individuals. She did everything right but a minute elevator ride was the only contact point between family B. After contact it spread pretty far.

Anyway know if Devilskin will still be playing in Hamilton Friday night?
"Arrgh, how infuriating."
uh oh
"Then, everything changed when the Coronavirus attacked"
Be safe.
Is there an expected reason? Seems like maybe an asymptomatic spreader? Or has it been dormant in this person for longer? Or dormant on some surface?

"Is there a handy official web page that has a table (or other view) view of level 1 vs 2 vs 3 ?

I've keep clicking from from one [https://www.health.govt.nz/](https://www.health.govt.nz/) page to another and get nuanced commentary/advise, but I'm looking for a summary with implicit comparisons even if that's ""everything in level 1 plus these ..""

Edit: Wikipedia has something - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19\_pandemic\_in\_New\_Zealand#Alert\_level\_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_Zealand#Alert_level_system) \- but that's not official.

Looking at the wikipedia account of levels, **no level includes** ""people in supermarkets on on busses/trains must be in face coverings"". I think that needs to fixed from level 2 and upwards.

My hatred for Auckland has been vindicated.
"Mods were jumping at the chance to sticky a thread from Kezza so much that they've completely overlooked the lockdown information and refuse to make it right, ignoring messages pointing it out. And they remove *any* posts which mention the lockdown, because ""there's already a thread.""

This is dumb AF. Clearly the lockdown announcement is far, far, far more important than ""one new case."" This is Civil Defence stuff. 

Remove this thread. Make a new one. This is ridiculous.

I'd assume a asymptomatic carrier that passed it on.
As an American I am jealous of your government's response and of your people's willingness to listen to doctors and scientists. Meanwhile over here we have to make sure the economy is okay and people believe masks infringe their rights... I hereby volunteer to become a citizen of New Zealand.

"What defines essential services for working through level 3? Already had an email expecting us in work everyday, not in health or food industry or anything remotely ""essential"" and think they are taking the piss tbh."
This is a head scratcher. And possible a very good clue to what this COVID really is. How is it that a country that have 0 new cases for so long and suddenly 3 person from the same family got it without any contact with the outside world.
"I wish I was in NZ right now!

Oh to have a strong plan and leadership like that!"

Yank here. That’s a decisive response. Glad your leadership group doesn’t want to see you dead like ours does.

"Meanwhile here in Manitoba, we're seeing more cases per day on average then at any point prior to now, with seemingly no plan to deal with it in sight. I'm envious of you guys for having leadership that is actually willing to respond to a health crisis.

All snark aside, best of luck nipping this in the bud guys! I'm glad to see at least someone is taking it seriously."
New Zealand originally thought covid was eliminated. This means that covid is more persistent than we thought.
I'm definitely going to close the stream before Tova gets in there
"This is how it is supposed to be done, as an American I am so envious of your united front and amazing handling of Covid cases. I wish we used our time sheltering in place to actually make this happen rather than bicker and squabble over masks."

Edit: I should probably clarify, why are the rest of the country under stricter lock down than Auckland?

Edit 2: Nevermind, I had the levels mixed up."
"Hi. No but I have my son coming home from Japan next week, have been trying to get him a flight since June."
Still only 22 deaths compared to 163k dead in the US. You’re doing great hon.
"Very disappointing but pleased our government has responded so quickly. Will be very interested in how this got back out. Maybe we need to severely reduce the amount of people allowed to come back at one time and quarantine and restrict that quarantine area to one area in NZ instead of quarantine hotels in every part of NZ as the people that are working in these quarantine places are obviously going home at nights. Maybe a health and safety issue there? This virus is so quick to take any opportunity! We can do this again NZ but if we are to keep sacrificing then boarder regulations have to be heaps stricter and honestly if you can’t handle quarantine because of what ever reason don’t come home. And don’t come to NZ on holiday for a few weeks cause your brother or whoever’s getting married or any other lame reason.  WTF is wrong with you people to go on small trips/ holidays in the middle of a pandemic. Really selfish! You’ve had months to come home. My son dragged himself home in March when it was obvious that the pandemic was here to stay. He didn’t want to come home but made that sacrifice as I told him it’s probably now of not for a very long time.
Plus from what I’m readying overseas, we NZ is in a pretty good place economy wise- in comparison to the rest of the world. Yes people have lost their jobs and the tourism industry has taken a massive hit but no drop in house prices and for a lot  people it’s been business as usual. Our town doesn’t rely on tourism so not much  has changed for us. Well get out the hand sanitiser and masks again 🥵"
Ashley and Jacinda both confirmed 4 cases. It was one man and 3 others in the household
Pisssssssss!
"So from the details given; one family with four cases but the suggestion seems to be that the 50 year old man is the source of the infection. However it's not known where he picked it up from. Also sounds like his job is quite mobile. 

Have to wonder if he's possibly a courier and picked it up somewhere among his deliveries? (Of course this is just total speculation on my part.) Have they released his employment type?"
"Asymptomatic cases are such a large percentage of cases that I think it's going to be almost impossible to stop this without a complete shut down for months, or a vaccine."
New Conservative needs to be aborted.
" I can't cook, could never get a delivery slot, have no family and last time I ended up with borderline malnutrition. 

I may die ironically from taking this seriously."
I guess the virus can stay dormant for longer than thought?
Stop international travel please for two weeks. No more people coming in.
Why start level 3 from 12 noon tomorrow? Is COVID19 having a sleep in?
"This is the fucking issue with the US. Single digit cases, they shut down. Meanwhile everyone in the US is too concerned about their “freedom” while people are dying. Sometimes, I hate living here."
"I know that some artists from overseas have come into Wellington...they get visa exceptions to work at Weta.

How closed is the border? Haven't a lot of NZ people from Europe been returning for months now?  I know a friend who just left LA to get out of the situation here.  She's been forced...obviously...into a managed hotel for 2 full weeks.

I just think that hundreds...if not thousands of people have returned via Auckland International.  I doubt it lies dormant.

If these people got it in their workplace...the workplace is dangerous and has been for a while.  It should be easy to track...but consider it's been 108 days that this has gone unchecked.

It's not 4 cases...if it's 4 it's probably 40"
"Ok.there was a Muppet. We only needed one, and this was predicted. Thank God there is a plan in place; we are probably going to go through a few of these incidents. Will remain concerned until the Christchurch resthome is cleared. If not, we are moving back into ""oh fuck"" territory."
"Fuck this, fuck Covid, fuck all you cunts not taking this seriously"
Rest of the country goes to Level 2.
Meanwhile we had 1000+ kooks sing and dance in a park in protest of church size limits. I guess some of them love their Jesus enough to try to see him early.
Level 4 here we come again for all of NZ by the end of the week I'd say. Christchurch may have it as well. Really hope it isn't the case and can be sorted in the next 3 days.
Rugby cancelled in the weekend? Fuck.
Someone in that chain of information is lying I’d guess

Barry Soper reporting Auckland will go into Level 3 lock down from 11:59 AM tomorrow. Travel in and out of Auckland will be prohibited.
Masks need to be mandatory.
How did this guy get the virus if it’s covid free there? Where did it come from how can they not find the source?
Could it be a false positive? I just don’t understand how or where this could have come from...
"This post is kind of confusing. Aren’t there three adult cases? Why does it say “first case is a man in his 50s”. Then “one case is a child”. Then “the two adult cases had quite obvious symptoms”. Then two paragraphs down says “the person is understood to have symptoms for five days”. 

Who is “the person” referring to and what happened to the two adults who also had “obvious symptoms” how many days was that? Why is the writing so difficult to decipher?

So is the case then:

There’s a family of 7 people. 1 person tested positive after showing symptoms for 5 days. The remaining 6 in the family were tested and 3 came back positive. Of the 3, 1 is a child not going to preschool or other group child care, and 2 are adults who also have symptoms (but no other details such as age or gender  or profession or possible exposure to others not in family discussed)."

Wow impressive response! seems like you guys have competent leadership. Here in america we got told drink bleach and its fake news from the democrats :( Good luck NZ!
"Is NZ still letting people out of managed isolation when they refuse a test? Asymptomatic carriers and spread are a thing, people."

I have to say I will avoid going in so early

I read somewhere that someone snuck out of managed isolation at the end of last month does that have anything to do with the new cases?

"From Vietnam, good luck New Zealand.

You broke our record ; ) , good job so far. We had new cases late Jul, just as you are having them right now.

The gov closed part of the country, I think you guys are doing the same, dont worry, thing will be back to normal before you know it. Good luck kiwis."

"So how is an essential worker classified over there? 

Because here in Wisconsin, US, when we shut down except for essential workers, they pretty much left it up to each business owner whether they were essential or not. My city is full of factories that employ tens of thousands of people. I don't know of one factory that was shut down. Pizza plants, cheese factories, paper making and converting, eye glass labs... They all stayed operating. The roads and highways were busy as usual. Only places that closed were bars, some restaurants, and salons. It was ridiculous."
This just tells me the virus is here to stay like the flu or the common cold. Also stupid question on my part. But if it’s here to stay and it will just keep coming back. How do we know it will ever be safe to go outside again? When the vaccine is created? Or something else
Mail?
"Seems fairly likely this would happen.

1. Person travels overseas, gets coronavirus. Is asymptomatic.

2. Asymptomatic person returns to NZ, transmits it to other people.

3. Other people, who never left, become symptomatic.

As long as you contact trace quickly you should be able to deal with it fairly easily."
There needs to be a really serious discussion about closing the borders to everyone except citizens
If we have to go up a level I'm going to be fucking pissed
Maybe something they received via mail?

"I've got some thoughts about this that I hope someone else can clarify.

1. Less than a few days ago, there was the ""respiratory illness"" breakout in ChCh. And now Auckland suddenly needs to go into lockdown cause' some cases were detected here.
2. I have a thought: maybe the actual situation is WORSE and the govt. is trying not to cause mass panic. Is this possibility even remotely likely?"
Not surprising at all. Real global numbers are probably between 100 to 150 million. Seems to be a lot of asymptomatic individuals or people who have barely noticeable symptoms they believe are trivial. Only go out when you need to and avoid contact with people until there's a vaccine or the world just decides to move on. NZ was the ideal global model but people are delusional if they really ever thought actual case numbers were non existent. It was certainly under control but I have no doubt it was still lingering in the community.

Antigen.

Who eating bats in New Zealand???
"This is so disappointing. I suppose it was inevitable that the virus would enter NZ again, but the fact that the source infected individual(s) went undetected highlights the ineffectiveness of our approach to COVID. How do we know there weren't more infected who were never forced to be tested, while we were all taking pride in 0 cases? Frankly, I really feel Jacinda could have done more to prevent this."
"Gary Brownlee was right with his suspicion. We all knew that recent scaremongering wasn't random. Why would govt suddenly turn their rhetoric by 360 degrees?

The government knew. They knew about community transmiton and probably tried to trace it down ""in silence"". And since they couldn't do it in time, they simply had no choice but to make it official.

I knew - from the moment the govt officials started suddenly -despite the fact NZ was in a really good position - talking about facemasks and the inevitability of community transmission, I knew.

I hope I am not the only one - this was such an obvious foreshadowing from govt, it could not have been more visible."

"Covid 19 coronavirus: Will Sweden get the last laugh? 
 https://nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12355353 

It may be time to reconsider our strategy going forward...

“After all, as Swedish public health experts kept saying, the struggle against this horrible pandemic ""is a marathon not a sprint"".

The World Health Organisation warns the impact may be felt for decades.”

“Many countries that believed they were past the worst are grappling with new outbreaks,"" said director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""Some that were less affected in the earliest weeks are now seeing escalating numbers of cases and deaths.""

“
Yet Sweden is seeing a sustained drop in cases, with some experts even suggesting it may be close to herd immunity in the capital Stockholm. The number of deaths, new cases and patients in intensive care has fallen dramatically.

On one key measure – percentage change in new confirmed cases over the past fortnight relative to the previous 14 days – Sweden is down more than a third.

This contrasts with sharp rises in neighbouring Denmark, Finland and Norway, along with countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.

Meanwhile, the latest data suggests Sweden is suffering less severe economic trauma than most major European nations, while it has, almost uniquely among Western countries, kept schools open.”

Edited for those who can’t be bothered reading the article. There’s no perfect response to this pandemic, we all know that. But we should at least be able to discuss the merits of both methods without tribalism getting in the way. That’s just my opinion."

I only found out when I put the dog out at 1 - then fuck me, I couldn't sleep"
"Was asleep when it came through, shat myself again just now when this mornings came through."
"Makes me wonder if we can have differing levels of national alert.

I'm glad I know, but I did not need to be woken up to be told that. To me nothing would have changed if I woke up in the morning and learnt about it. However, if a Tsunami was 20 minutes away, being woken is is called for."
"Either do not disturb blocked it (as it should), or I slept right through it. Got one hell of a fright at 0655 this morning when it came through again though!"
There’s something haunting and kind of terrifying about the alert noise.... I suppose it makes you pay attention!

Quarantine guy popping out for some sneaky hot chips
You don't fluke multiple false negatives. A person could consistently report false negatives based on their physiology.
They haven't been able to link it to managed isolation. My bet is that there has been a low level amount of transmission that have gone undetected. The number of tests have been extremely low compared to other countries.

Doc said to come in for a test last Thurs, it was easy as (drive through and all, great set up at my medical centre). Even though at that stage community transmission seemed like a not-very-likely, it felt surprisingly good to get that negative result back on Friday.  Feels even better now with the news tonight. I would definitely be a lot more stressed right now if I hadn't had that test already."
"They did have symptoms for 4-5 days before getting tested, and that kind of delay is enough to make contact tracing almost ineffective (unless everyone has very few contacts). Fair enough being the first case in an outbreak, but anyone with symptoms now needs to be testing EARLY"
"Maybe there should be some sort of reward, people get like $1500 for testing positive. It would certainly boost the number of people who get a test if they feel even slightly off."

No it means I have to start jogging again.
Always has been.
My whisky supply is worryingly low. Oh dear.
Only frlm midday tomorrow bro
Yeah baby. Simple as that - we got rid of it once and we'll get rid of it again 🤘
"I'm kinda thankful we've got to see the shit show USA has going on with the masks, hoping itll mean people here see the benefits of wearing one."

"And I am going to lose the stone i put on last time. Seriously, where are the weight gain olympics? I would nail it for nz"
I believe in you!!
This is hopefully just more like a bump in the road. Very sad it happened just after the 100 days but I think kiwis will have hope and do things right again. Hope all goes well for you over there.
"True, it is a little sinking feeling but also, I think long-term this will be the optimal strategy.

Life is good life is good oh a case quick lock the fuck down for a month cheers all is well life is good ad nauseum"
"Yeah, as an Australian currently living in NZ, I really feel for my fellow Aussies that are in lockdown states. But you’ve got no one else to blame but the incompetent state governments and some of the absolute brain dead citizens that refuse to follow the rules. I’ve got full confidence in the NZ PM and how seriously this is being taken. It’s great to see that a lockdown is being imposed almost straight away."
"He'll be back to dailies for the next while.

At least the next 28 days id expect"

"Seconded from another old mate across the ditch.
Best of luck."
"We'll wait and see. If it does, well that's life in the fast lane, isn't it?"
"Thanks, hope you're keeping safe yourself too :)"
I wish our government could pull the finger out. BellyJiggles is in denial.
"In Victoria and the half assed stuff ended up leading to a level 4 lockdown anyway. If you're going to do it, might as well get it over with and do it right first time round."
"My grandfather died during level 4. We had finally organised a proper memorial for him that was supposed to happen on Saturday. 

Honestly, all I can do is laugh. Fucking 2020."
Fuck. Sorry.
Sorry for your loss.
"I'm sorry for your loss. 

That must be a hard blow to hear.

Are you able to visit tomorrow morning, and say your goodbyes?"
Sorry for your loss
"Fucking sucks, sorry to hear"
"Mate, I'm so sorry. That's horrible."
"Sorry for your loss, you don't need this making this time tougher!"
I'm sorry for your loss
So sorry for your loss.
"Sad to hear, hopefully after 3 days it goes back down and you can go"
I am so so sorry to hear this :( My condolences to you and your family.
Sorry to hear that
Sorry to hear. Funerals up to 10 people still allowed in Auckland. 100 outside of auckland.
so sorry to hear this
"My condolences from the other side of the world, stay strong."
"I recently had to attend my grand-fathers funeral,  we have some covid measures in place lile social distancing and masks.  It was weird...  and if you think people mourning won't hug each other I have news for you..."
I'm sorry for you and your families loss. Condolences friend.
"That's rough, so sorry for your loss. Hugs."
"Hey, but heaps of people from Australia got to use their dying relative as an excuse to get out of quarantine early."
The funeral was going to be held within three days? That's pretty quick.
Same with those sick people in the rest homes i was actually caught off guard when they said the spread was in south auckland
My money is on a quarantine bus driver also being a public transport bus driver and oops sorry here's your change with a side of infectious disease.
"Aw man that sucks.. :/ hang in there, hopefully it ll just be a few days.."
Tomorrow is my shopping day!
"Actually at the end of the lockdown I got a new job (lost everything going into it). My partner and I both get paid monthly and have started to do monthly shops now (with weekly to fortnightly veggie shops). Get paid on the 15th. We are right before our monthly shop 🙄

Here's to hoping next week we are out of lockdown and can go get groceries. FFS"
Heard Countdowns website is already crashing.
Need some toilet paper after that hit... Off to the shops.
"They should have signed it ""Good luck, Donald Trump""."
"The one time the whole country gets an alert and there'd be thousands who had no fucking clue before they read it.

Was driving through to Pukekohe when I got it and fuck I'm still not getting over it"
I say we wall off Auckland and keep it that way ;-)
TVNZ website crashed on the livestream.

Either way, we are in a better position this time. Less cases. 

I just hope people don’t get stupid about not wearing a mask in crowded areas like they are in the US."
Good lord THIS. As a Kiwi living in the US I’m finding reading this thread surreal. The level of freak out is..... something. I get it - y’all been super fortunate due to excellent leadership for which I’m incredibly grateful given my entire immediate family is at home. Tbh - take a moment - you’ve got this. I promise. I’m living the new normal daily here. I guess you could say we’ve adjusted. Stay grateful. With love.
I've gotta find masks first. I think they're are a few boxes at work but gotta head in early to get em. Not like I slept much last night anyway.

Thank you! I hope you all are keeping safe and well.

"Most aren't wearing masks. Must be because you can't transfer it until Noon tomorrow, That's the rules /s"

They'll still have all the baking supplies they never used from last time.

I might get a chance to perfect my sourdough recipe.
I'm still going through the sack of rice I brought in March to play it safe.
"This is going to be a struggle for many....we thought we were free of this, but this was always going to be a marathon.

Lockdown is going to help.  We will have time to trace and find where it came from before more people are exposed.  We will get through this."
11.30 lunch instead before everything closes?
Atleast your not in America where we can go to the bakery but really risk exposing ourselves to the virus
"Aussie here, but NZ really punches above their weight on many metrics. [Check them out coming in first place on the Human Freedom Index.](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index-new)"
How about some of us more crafty ones making masks for supermarket workers??
Hot kiwi returns home. Randy security guard. Sounds notty.
"Yeah it's weird. They also seem to think that we were bragging about having it under control. This is not a competition, and I think it's appalling that people view it that way.
We are in a shared global public health emergency. People in NZ, just like those everywhere else, have lost their jobs, lost family members---let's not forget those here who did pass away, and are also fully aware we have to be prepared to drop everything for re-emergences and disruptions for possibly years to come. We do what we can and celebrate the successes when/if they come."
"I just wish we had a government that could actually respond to a crisis, it's neat to watch what a real country can do"
"This American wishes we would just get our shit straight already. This is not how I wanted to spend 2020... 

I've been watching, wishing, and being jealous over how some places are doing *so* much better than our shitshow."
I’m just hopelessly jealous. I’m an out of work restaurant worker with no end in sight. Your guy’s swift response is so incredible.
I'm a kiwi that works with Americans (in Canada). I know they'll have a fucking opinion about it. God damn do they love to talk about themselves and really think the rest of the world wants their take on things

Panic buying definitely stops community transmission 😕
Wait we have 24 hour Countdowns?
[deleted]
"They all shut early and police are out in force, in fact I can hear the helicopter flying over right now. Countdown put out a statement saying they have weekly meetings about the return to lockdown. From opening tomorrow morning buy limits are in place as well as social distancing measures, limits on people allowed in store and also they they have bigger reserves of items which got panic bought during lockdown one."
Well they should have learned from last time and installed handsprays.
"https://covid19.govt.nz/covid-19/restrictions/auckland/

>Gatherings of up to 10 people can continue, but only for wedding services, funerals and tangihanga. Physical distancing and public health measures should be maintained.

But otherwise yeah no gatherings."
"> Edit: this is for Auckland. The rest of you are fine.

And up to 100 for the rest of us."
Yup. Here’s the document https://covid19.govt.nz/assets/resources/tables/COVID-19-alert-levels-summary.pdf
More or less yeah... work work remotely where you can
"Wash your hands, wear a mask if you cannot social distance, record your location (with the app), no large (>100) gatherings."
"Yes. I believe so. Sign in everywhere, table service only, distancing in place."
"Rest of New Zealand
The rest of New Zealand will move to Alert Level 2 at 12 noon on Wednesday 12 August.

You can still continue to go to work and school, with physical distancing.

Wear masks if you can in public.

No more than 100 people at gatherings, including weddings, birthdays, funerals and tangihanga.

Businesses can open to the public if they are following public health guidance, which include physical distancing and record keeping.

People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, for example those with underlying medical conditions and old people are encouraged to take additional precautions when leaving home.

Practice good hygiene - stay home if sick.

Detailed information about life at Alert Level 2 is available."
Deleting my Facebook account at the start of the year was honestly liberating.
"To be fairrr, that is Facebook"
My flatmate read through a few of them. New heights of ignorance.
Perhaps the authoritarianism that they're complaining about might be actually necessary this time.
"Got one of the conspiracy theorists in my house, it's a nightmare"
What are the conspizes on about now
Don't use Facebook. Your brain will thank you.
"Are you sure? Because according to this sub's gleeful high-horse patronising over the past few weeks, apparently America is the only country that has people who do that kind of shit."
"How many Aucklanders flew down for a ski holiday in the last few days?

Not good. 

Though I personally agree with you."
"I'm surprised it isn't in the level system, is there a reason why it wouldn't be?"
Probably already cases in the South Island by now you would assume.
"Yeah, let us keep living normally please. Fuck the North Island, they can deal with their own shit."
The govt have said they are expecting more cases. I highly doubt this is a 3 day thing.
"Where did you see it was only for 3 days?
Edit: I am big retard. Not rated for reading big posts at night haha"
Kinda difficult when they've spent this whole time saying restrictions were *too* harsh.
Roads would've stopped it.
"National will say they would have handled the managed isolation facilities better, while letting in rich Americans to spread the virus as they please"
Discount fares from Auckland to other parts of the North Island....I think today is an ideal day to start...
"These morons don't realise that the level 4 and 3 lockdown are the reason we don't have perpetual level 2 like Europe. Yes, they have perpetual level 2. Which would these guys prefer, a few weeks of level 3/4, or level 2 that **never ends**?"
"Why is Antifa such a boogeyman for these morons.

Are they inadvertently calling themselves facists?"
"Oh dear Hobbits, please be joking."
">Billy Te Kahika

Hes on FB claiming he has military documents leaked to him that state both lockdowns were planned and military is going to invade our homes at the hands of a hostile government and blah blah.

They're probably the same people that dont even think it's real.
Fuck those guys NZ is still 1000x times handling shit better than we are in the US
"On the internet, no one knows when your a dog.

Or Russian troll who shit on everyone to destabilize things."
"Upvote for accurate perception.  As an American, our government is fueled by just that sentiment:

Blame shift, ignore the problem, blame everyone else, fail to fix the problem.

Using the Covid Map, we can see which countries actually cooperate and take care of each other, and which ones don't give a damn about facts, safety, or each other.

Republicans ruined America, and their partnership with Russia and Putin just shows. And no one can argue that.

Republicans hate America and the world"
"Don't act like everyone else doesn't shit on America 24/7. We've got our problems but Lord almighty I can't tell you how many smug Canadian/European assholes seem to just think we're all gun toting, Bible thumping, cousin fucking rednecks who vote red for anything. But God forbid that I say that I don't like the way Canada/England/EU handles a certain thing, because anyone else can have an opinion about us but my opinions are punishable by crucifixion"
"Let's not pretend the entirety of Reddit doesn't sit around all day waiting to shit on the US.

I was just thinking this...
I did not 😩
Lucky you! Tomorrow was meant to be a day off for me but I guess I’m driving in to the city to get my computer or else I won’t be able to work for the rest of the week.
Fuck! I did not.
I did not and now I'm stressing about taking the bus in tomorrow
You can still pass the kids between the two homes. You just become one giant bubble. I don't think you can if they live in another town during level 4 though. Just has to be local.
Check my info but in level 3 you can establish a bubble that includes them. Not sure of that's possible with level 4
You can have an extended family bubble as long as neither of you see anyone else
I'm the same situation. Was told that separated parents are treated as being in the same bubble.
Thanks for the replies :)
"Hmm, will this help? [COVID alert levels ](https://covid19.govt.nz/assets/resources/tables/COVID-19-alert-levels-detailed.pdf). It does mention family, but your case is special. Sorry if this isn't helpful."
Yes you can visit. In Level 3 and in Level 4...just keep your bubble as small as possible
"Not during lockdown, stay in your bubble"

"As one of the sane Americans, I’m sorry that you have more cases, and hope those people get well. 

It’s sad that we can’t even be decent human beings for 5 seconds and realize how dangerous this virus is. And our leadership in America doesn’t help the situation at all."
"I don’t agree with them saying things like “get rekt” but sooo many of your countrymen online have been gloating and basically telling us Americans to “get rekt” for the past few months due to our COVID cases. So if they can dish it out, they need to be able to take it"

"Glad I made a pasta dish that will last me a full week.

"I got to visit your city last year, loved it. Hope I can return one day for another visit. All the best to you guys fro  Wellington too."
"Yeah, has to be. 

- staff at facilities or airport

- false negative testing and interbubble transmission at iso facilities

- escapees"
"Prime Minister said so far, there’s no link of tonights community cases from the managed isolation facilities"
">Really doubtful it was 100+ days of asymptomatic transmission so in my humble uneducated opinion, this has to have been from the border, right?

Pretty much."
"No, it is statistically possible because they haven't been testing enough people."
"There's no other way, I say we close the border and that's that.

Edit and of course do the lockdown and everything till we get back to 0 cases again. Then still don't open the borders"
Pls no
"Yeah, we knew it was going to come back, but this is basically worst case scenario unfortunately. No obvious chain of transmission, could have been in the community for days/weeks

Hopefully quick action will mean the damage is limited"
Fuck these days i wouldnt be surprised if it was planted by a jealous country..

the photo on RNZ of the guy with 48 rolls of TP clearly plans to do a lot of shitting and wanking over 3 days
I was going to do my usual weekly shop tomorrow... might give it a miss for a couple of days.
Yea. Let’s just lockdown the country again and borrow some more billions.
"All those people with symptoms but thought ""no community transmission, can't be Covid"" will be panicking tonight. They'll probably do over 10,000 tests in AK alone tomorrow."
"High.

Tomorrows numbers will be low, because theyll be the result of today, so maybe 2 to 3k, but Thursdays is gonna show 7k+"
It will be chaos....
RIP my wrists
"Agree, really at this point we should assume minimum  incubation cycle of level 4. Remember when we went back through level 3 coming  out of 4.. cindy said then that level 3 is a holding period to go level 2 or 4.

In the next 48 hrs even if we tested everyone in auckland we still wouldn't get people who have been infected as of today and have not yet developed enough antigens for the test to pick up. The lag effect sucks, but lockdown works.."
"Yeah I'm betting on level 4 by next week. If it's out in the community there's no way they can track down every single potential contact within 3 days, and then people might still only become symptomatic in two weeks."
"Exactly. Just like last time. 3 days of L3, then L4 for 6 weeks."
Well that's one way to look at this lol
"lol I have one tomorrow but it was online. So still going ahead and this has sapped my ability to study. Ah well, it’ll be scaled since no doubt everyone else feels the same way"
😂the gods was looking out for you on that one

The post was tentatively made prior to the announcement but kezza continually updated with information.
"Yeap, stay away guys! A bunch of crowding outside and inside a supermarket is a great way to expose yourself to a lot of people you don’t know, and potentially catch it, without being able to contract trace easily!"
Good lord we have some idiots in NZ. Seriously people are more worried about having something to wipe their arse with than actually getting covid.
"And then there will be the people in the supermarket taking photos of the ""others"" who are *also* stocking up, trying to pretend that 10pm supermarket runs are their normal"
Can't be a coincidence.

"Thank you very much!

These are all really appreciated words, especially considering the hammering and nitpicking we’re about to get on a world stage."
I don’t get this position at all. Like... if you delay a lockdown it’ll be like Victoria and then you’ll do a lockdown anyway - and a longer one. (With a bit of freedom beforehand I’ll give her that). Mathematically you do it early and hard. To me the only other alternative is to not do it at all. There is no happy grey area if you ask me. Fuck she’s retarded

"I suspect it will here too, but hopefully we can isolate it quickly. And I don't really ever play this card, but we have a leader with a track record of keeping our spirits up in hard times."
"You'd think NZ would have a much better chance because of the lower population density, meaning surely a naturally lower R0 prior to becoming aware of the outbreak."
Chur bro!
"Cheers, mate. You stay safe, too!"
"I dunno, those fuckwits Hosking and his ilk on talkback have been saying that the government preparing us for another outbreak was scaremongering for the election. Cunts should have to apologise on air."
Hopefully she keeps herself busy with undermining herself and national.
"Shes probably prepping all the redfaced blowhards now, they must all be racing to get their ""overeaction! Incompetence!"" headlines in now, ignoring the fact that national has been calling to open the gates for weeks now"
"The prejudging is awesome, really cool!!!"
"Yeah, it's amazing, ordinary Kiwis, some of them mates of mine, believing in Lizard overlords etc etc."
">Coming after the warnings about the inevitability of this event, and the warnings to have masks on hand

There was a lot of this stuff in the news during past week tbh. And Ashley's warning about masks after 100 days of COVID-free did seem a bit offbeat. No wonder tinfoil hatters are suspicious now."
"My colleague is calling it the 'plandemic' and sharing all this bs rhetoric in our group chat. It's bloody annoying! Not to mention it makes me mad hearing that kind of shit, despite trying hard to avoid it."
I've got conspiracy chatter in my family group chat. I honestly thought my family had brains. Funny thing is almost none of them live in Auckland.
"I'm usually in the same boat as you but they have been pushing for people to go buy masks and today Bloomfield invited the press to watch him get tested, just seems a bit coincidental  


""Aw shit, this cunt said it seems coincidental he must think Jacinda made the virus in her back yard or national is going to use covid to build roads or something"" you anti-conspiracy theorist are actually worse than the conspiracy theorists"
Can we have a Mike hosking alert level?
"He's been moaning for weeks that we shouldn't be getting tested cause there isn't any Covid in NZ.

Now he can moan that the government failed. 

He was going to moan either way."
Or in his wife's pants.
Like a whiff of dust...
This made me wheeze laugh lol. I can just imagine the state he is in right now
ZOOM it.
My wife did the same. Maybe they can do the interview over Skype or zoom. Really bad timing. We are in Hamilton though. Good luck.
Job interview? Sorry to hear that :/
Doesn't it start at noon tomorrow? Liquor store owners would be mad to not stay open tomorrow morning for the inevitable rush.
"Good luck mate, please do let me know how you get on."
I literally went to the liquor store after the announcement. They aren't closed.
"Wishing you the best from New Zealand, kia kaha stay strong."
"Sorry to hear, but good that you go back into lock down instead of saying ""it is what it is"""
"Yes, Auckland will be in level 3 for three days and the rest of the country will be in level 2 for three days."
At midnight. They're setting up road blocks in and out too in the morning.
I have a deep chesty cough since Friday. F u c k

"Nice one, please do, thank you!"
"So did I, should I also?"
Yes.
"Wait, we were supposed to stop?"
I bought some really posh sweatpants in preparation. Three zippered pockets! And tight elastic cuffs so there's no gap of vulnerability where my poor naked ankle is exposed and my socks have fallen down. I'm so ready.
FTW!
at least we have fall guys
Challenge mode: Build an island Minas Tirith. You've got 3 days.
Next patch is only in October :(
No it's not. Get that 5 star and make it amazing. Redecorate your house. And most importantly get that blue rose
ON GOD :(
Same here. The last week has been brutal
"My thinking  is because we were at level 1 and this was an unknown source I expect cases to pop up outside Auckland.

I think nz will be at level 3 by end of week.

I don't think nz will go into full lockdown again just level 3, which is partial lockdown. I am guessing covid  cards will also become mandatory"
Possibly but stay cool cause we did this before and didn't run out of toilet paper....we got this.
"Good question, based on the fact they expect more cases.... yes."
"I don’t think it’s confirmed they’ll move to level 4, but it’s definitely a possibility if it gets worse"
"What's it like in Japan at the moment? I wanted to get a working holiday visa for next year, but all visa applications are closed and I will age out of the eligible bracket in October :("
"I’m in the United States and we average 50,000 cases a day and our federal government lies and says everything is great. The forecast is 250,000 dead by Thanksgiving and people are screaming they need college football."
Yeah but think about Volkswagen!!!elf
Returning home is fine
Yep
"5 mins before my alarm went off, extra annoying"
"Hey guys, 6:55 emergency wake up crew here."
Getting BCP calls at midnight was worse lol
Yeah not like I have to go work all day dealing with people panicking or anything no no don't need any sleep
It's the same time as my alarm.
[deleted]
Shit paperrrrrrr 🎶
Though everyone would still be stocked up from last time.
"Surely the people who panic bought all their toilet paper, still HAVE all their toilet paper."
Aw shit here we go again
"Hahaha, incredible honestly. Why toilet paper? We were never going to run out last time and you're hardly going to die without it."
People bought out all the masks at my work last week...
Yes. Hard not to see it being extended though. These people are bound to have spread it.
Seems that way.
Level 3*
[deleted]
Considering it only took 4 cases and not 400 there may be hope.
I blame the guy who broke out to buy wine at countdown.
That seems to be the logical link though
How do countries let quarantine failure happen? Should be 5 fences with armed guards if the whole countries economy and health is at stake
Ready to give covid 5 million fucking whacks
We caught a case. Government reacts immediately. We come down hard on it. We'll get it under control. There's nothing for them to be smug about.
"Crush it and they'll be applauding us. React slowly like Melbourne and they'll be ""you fucked up""."
Tbf NZ was being pretty smug about not having it
I was warning people just yesterday about humble pie as kiwis were running around acting smug.
And again? And the time after that?
Post is on popular.
We come to see what a functioning society does in these situations. Hope and dream for a better tomorrow
Any idea how many times countries have asked that question?
"Looking to immigrate.

We're really missing a functioning government."
"They jumped on their mobility scooters to come over and scream about how you're all paranoid libtard Democrats who are scared of a fake Kung flu virus from Wuhan, and you're violating their rights to free speech if you disagree."
Well you are on an American website.

"Just reading through the post and comments, I am so impressed and envious. I’d welcome the inconvenience of restrictions in order to actually tackle the problem (southern US)."
As an American in NZ I'll tell you it feels surreal and amazing. I'm very grateful and concerned about family and friends back home.
Kezza is Ashley Bloomfield.
Wait Gaben was holding a concert here? How did I not hear about this!
"I just heard on the radio, Phoenix Foundation just announced a tour :("
Thankyou ✌🏼
Might have something do with right wing governments that are in denial
"New Zealand is a remote island with few global visitors and has less than 5 million people and its largest city, Auckland, is smaller than Phoenix, AZ.  These people claiming they are some heroes or amazing or showing the world how to do it are ridiculous.

There are almost two times as many people packed into NYC alone as there is in all of New Zealand!  New York City alone probably has 100 times the number of international travelers and visitors than all of New Zealand.  Maybe you should praise Antarctica while you are at it.  I hear they have no cases.  They must have done an amazing job!"
I planned on crying tonight anyway.
I'm up for this!
Seriously! Like I’ll sacrifice what they did if it means my family and I being alive.
"I haven't seen anyone trying to justify it.  All I've seen are people excited to witness the proper handling of a national crisis.  It seems the big gripe is the number of Americans here (an American website, btw).  You could take the well-wishes graciously, or you could prove that American-style entitlement has made it halfway around the world."
"It’s fucking sad. We’re all fucked over here. All I can do is wear my mask, mind my my own business, and vote the orange ape out of office. Then hope for the best."
Depends if the more cases are in Auckland or not.
"If they find it's only in auk probably, if they find more across the country then we're fucked for a little bit"
"I'd expect the rest of us to be in level 3 if Auckland goes to level 4, personally."
Level 3 is Level 4 with takeaways
https://covid19.govt.nz/covid-19/restrictions/alert-system-overview/
Level 2 is basically Level 1 with a limit on gatherings and keeping 2m away from people when out and about which is how I live anyway.
"“All schools to close except for Children of essential service workers”

In Auckland I’d say yes"
>All schools to close except for Children of essential service workers.
Yes in Auckland they are shut. Rest of the country schools are open
"Yes, except for children of essential workers"
"In Auckland, yes."
"For all except children of essential workers. Wait for an update from your school.

My school will start online learning again on Thursday.

E. Yes, important distinction. This is Auckland only."
"Yeah, for all but kids of essential workers."
"In Auckland yes, rest of NZ I believe school will continue."
"Realistically it already is. Add the lag effect of \~3 days before antigen testing typically picks it up...   


But hopefully a full on testing blitz over the next few days combined with lockdown will isolate it fast.  


Suspect Auckland will be L4 by Friday, possibly whole country."
"It doesn't teleport. I heard (somewhere) that it typically doubles every few days. So ""well out there"" could be like 20 people."
"The US hasn't, we're still all dying from the first wave...it's never gonna end enough to have a second wave, sigh."
"Same here, they're gonna be overwhelmed with people wanting to get tested tomorrow"
"I called in sick today with a sore throat developing in Dunedin, will be contacting GP about a test tomorrow. I think anyone that's feeling ill anywhere should get tested because it could literally be anywhere at this point."
"I say we cut the tether and push the north island off towards Australia, set it on fire for good measure."

"This government needs to tighten up, stop being weak, and stamp this thing out! And also open up to the rest of the world for $!! And also remain isolated!!! And also put the travel bubble in place!!!"
"Yeah he's been banging on about opening the border up for weeks

$100 says he blames the govt for not closing the border tighter"
"It really doesn't hurt, I felt the discomfort has been blown out of proportion."
how long it takes to get the result?
"My local community group already has posts of ""Polls must be looking bad for Labour. How to stop the opposition winning the election 101"". Like yes, we're going into lockdown solely to stop the election."
It's gonna take at least half a day to make sure all their candidates have deleted their tweets endorsing things like auctioning off entry visas before National can pretend they are for strong borders.
It’s coming don’t worry
EVERYBODY GET THE CUNT
By any chance have you visited an old folks home recently........
Unclean! Unclean! ;-)
"That's gonna be the thing, those dang auckland travellers."
There’s an old folks home under lockdown..
We can do the fuck you covid dance socially distanced outside in our bubbles

"Once they discover the source of the cases, hopefully they do take appropriate action."
"Nothing wrong with cargo.

The weakness is likely to be in isolation. The case announced earlier today tested negative on day 3 and positive on day 12. Lots of time in between to spread it to others who could test negative on day 12 and then be spreading it in the community."
"As long as the virus is extant in the international community and borders are open to any degree then the virus will return. A second wave was inevitable, as are further waves unless something changes. 

The government did a great job on eliminating the virus, but elimination is easier than keeping the virus out if you have people entering the country. Unfortunately just takes one slip-up and then you have community transmission.

Hopefully vaccines come soon and COVID is contained globally.  Otherwise, New Zealand has a difficult decision - either completely seal the border or learn to live with rolling lockdowns."
"That possibility is still way better than what any other western country is doing. Its way better than unending level 2, and it's way better than just letting the virus spread."
"Yeah, I think we got a bit complacent given the success of the measures so far... but we need to further resource and put some additional moats and mitigations around quarantine staff, aircrew, etc and maybe even cold-chain cargo... it needs to stay watertight. Rolling lockdowns are not going to help the economy either."
"My brothers wife is a NZ resident and they just finished their 12 day state-mandated quarantine in Mairangi Bay after they landed from Macedonia. 

AFAIK NZ will soon require everyone entering the country to pay for the quarantine themselves ($3-4k per person). I think that’s a pretty good policy and will definitely defer a lot of people from entering."
It will be a regional isolation in guessing at this stage.
Auckland is at level 3 for a few days it seems
AKL lvl 3 for 3 days
"Auckland moves to level 3 from 12 noon tomorrow for 3 days. Take care, team."
Auckland level 3 rest of nz level 2
"**Auckland** (the wider Auckland region, ie; up to Wellsford) will be going to Level 3 as of midday Wednesday 12th, for three days (or until Friday midnight?) The rest of New Zealand will be moving to Level 2 for the same period."
[deleted]
I’ll get back into it if we don’t get this nailed down by Friday. Let’s hope that we caught this outbreak early enough and a swift sharp response damps it down.
Yeast. Edmond be praised.

You're on the Internet. Its not hard to find.
Mate turn that shit off.
national radio would like a word
Love Marcus Lush Nights but I had to stop listening for the sake of my blood pressure. Already shitheads blaming it all on Jacinda and conspiracy nuts on the air.
It's all jacinda's fault /s
"In the press conference the PM stated that people can travel to Auckland to return home if that’s where they live and they are outside the city, or if they are in the city but don’t live there, they can leave to travel home."
You can travel back into Auckland if that is your home
Surely you can finish your holiday and return whenever? So long as the rest of the country isn’t put into lvl 3?
If you're returning home to Auckland during level 3 that's fine
They said you can go home. I have a flight back to Auckland on Thursday. Shouldn't be a trouble.
"It does say 12 pm onwards, yeah."
You're allowed to travel home to Auckland if you aren't currently there.
"Take solace in the fact that your country has a very detailed plan <3 you'll get right back to that 100 days virus free again soon, I'm sure. 

Be safe."
Back and already locking down. You’ll be able to plug it. It’s 4 cases not 400
"This is what I'm saying. NZ has pretty much been executing every precaution to the tee and you still can't escape it. I don't understand why we keep trying to half ass with this thing. Let it run its course and keep it moving or go full lockdown (like everyone, every country even ""essential workers"") for 6 weeks (give folks a month to gather what they need)or quit acting like local eradication is going to mean anything in the grand scheme of things. At this rate this is going to be our way of life for years to come because we're half assing everything. I'm personally not going to give a fuck if that's the case, if I die then I die, if someone else goes then they go. I can't be playing this accordion game for the rest of my life. I think that's why so many people are non compliant. When you don't set strict parameters with real repercussions, it just doesn't work."
I commented earlier how a lot of Americans have become numb too many things that just 10 years ago would have been ludicrous. We're forgetting where the line is. We're allowing incompetence to become the norm and I feel like one voice being drowned in a sea of thousands defending this new norm is ok.
"*thinking man meme*

Can't have a second wave if you never leave the first one."
Lots of industries can't just stop on a dime. You need time to close down properly without costing big $.
"I know its painful seeing so many braindead americans here, we really need some kinda verification process to stop shit like this from happening"
"Right. This is less daunting than the task we faced in March,waning we'll need less luck to go our way to work through it again."
"Would have preferred just to quarantine properly.

And test everyone working at covid hotels, not just now, but from level 4 last time!"
"Hey, let's kick some covid ass together. We did it once let's do it again. Show the world why NZ is the best. 

Covid got nothing on NZ spirit."
"Thanks, but yeah, we'll hopefully get through this. I'm suspecting those who weren't keen on lockdown the first time around would not comply. One Talkback station was full of people with that attitude and the other (ZB) they're not acting like that so... 🤷"
No worries cobber; piece of piss!
"We feel for you too... we struck gold with exceptional leadership, but the virus doesn't discriminate.. We'll all get through this!"

Im glad it’s not just me who noticed this! Shocking how many there are

That's what happens when the Govt has repeatedly lied about Covid-related news though.

"Yeah I think it knocks you back again but we know what we have to do and even though it can be tough we can get through this. Supermarkets won't run out, you can still get your prescriptions. It's the lonliness that makes it hard so we have got to be there for eachother (from a distance). Kia kaha NZ."
Enough diseases there as it is
They already said it was in South Auckland
You must have to expect it's already there.
same... mine happens to be tomorrow lol welp
Same here. And usually I moan cus it always rains.
F
We were planning my friends party when the announcement happened
:/
Every cloud has a silver lining
"I think this case goes to show that it wasn’t actually stamped out in the first place, which is very depressing."
"the possibility is there anyway because people currently IN Auckland who don’t usually reside there are free to travel within the country to get home. 

source: Jacinda said it during the media conference"
Hopefully those 2 rest homes that shut down today aren’t related
">This should serve as a reminder that just because there or zero cases does not mean that the virus went away. Its not possible to test everyone so there are going to be individuals passing it around.


Exactly. Too many people assumed all symptomatic people were tested and as if asymptomatic cases didn't exist."
"Imagine if we had tested a million people.

At 99.999% accuracy, that's a thousand false positives. And the tests aren't actually that accurate.

With widespread transmission, ""yeah, we'll keep an eye on you, for now stay home"" is a good idea. When there's no one with symptoms and a positive test, the hysterical ""test everyone"" ranting is more irritating than helpful."
The virus came from animals and I can assume it can be transmitted back to them.
"Pfft, a real American just dies when they get sick. Why would a tiny pandemic change that!?"
"But but but, our frreedom, guns, Muircaaaa"
They got their shit sorted
"I can picture the scene in my mind....

Aaruuuga, aaruuuuga... We have 3 cases in the wild! Invoke defcon 5 pandemic response! 

Everyone count off in 3's. First group will on our command run around in circles waving their hands above their heads wailing uncontrollably. 2's must assume a kneeling position and begin to loudly emote ""what about the children!"". 3's must don round rimmed glasses, coats with patches on the elbows and throw hardback copies of books at everyone while screaming ""we don't know about the long term effects of (insert whatever disease you want here)."" My favorite is herpes, but use whatever you like. 

We will now hand the magic decision stick to the head Karen. Karen - ""the con is yours and godspeed to us all, especially the store managers and anyone who forgot their mask on the way to the grocery!"" Aaaaruuuga, aaaaruuuga! Commence response plan!

Karen - ""I need to more wailing out of the 2's. Make me feel it! 3's need to shift to denouncing and cancelling everything that seems like it might be fun. Let's go people!""

NZ, according to the former Ohio Medical Director, Amy Acton, you now have by definition at least a minimum of 100,000 cases due to community spread. How's that make you feel? Didn't you kiwis learn anything? Nature will find a way..."
"Imagine having a government that defers to the experts in situations like this as well as the majority of the public actually following their recommendations. 

But we can’t have nice things because muh freedoms of liberty."
"Thankyou for your positive words of encouragement, friend"
🤛
"From the US: reading that they will not only test those around the confirmed cases, but thousands of other people.... that sounds so far fetched from what we're doing. I'm sick of this shit. It can't be this hard for us to have good, speedy testing."
Must be easy for a country with no neighboring land countries and 4 million people... Piss off with the USA comparison.
"Sure, feel free to pass this note along:

>!Don't be dumb"
The first time I went to Auckland since the isolation hotels have been there I was so shocked. Why are they literally right in CBD?!?
"They're from South Auckland, but at least 3 workplaces that aren't in South Auckland. So if it has been spread to a workplace, then it could be anywhere.

Take the same amount of care wherever you are. Like they said at the very start of level 4, act like you, and the people around you, have Covid-19. There's no downside to being cautious. It sucks, and it's hard, but we can do it."
"South Auckland, but there are four different workplaces involved across Auckland."
"South Auckland, kid goes to school in Mt Albert though. Lots of chances for transmission over the last week. Poor bastards, hope they aren’t feeling bad over this."
South Auckland but they worked beyond South Auckland. No more details than that at the moment
South Auckland but some of their work places are outside of South Auckland.
South auckland
They said south Auckland on the announcement
American here. More envious than anything else. Wish my Kakistocracy of a government had a national strategy like this for containment.
The ones that are laughing are the same fuckfaces refusing to do anything to help prevent this pandemic. I'm over here wondering how the hell do you guys have any at all. My worst fear is the virus can some how awaken again in our bodies.
You're not meant to travel non essentially
https://covid19.govt.nz/covid-19/restrictions/alert-system-overview/#alert-level-2-%E2%80%94-reduce
If you aren't in Auckland currently then I guess so
Nope
Probably back to Jacinda/Bloomfield 1pms again for a while too. Nice to have the routine.
"Thanks for the kind words. We're doing our best and so far that has worked out well. But there is potential for complacency and straight out stupidity/willful ignorance from the peanut gallery, unfortunately. FWIW, I wish only the best for you and yours and for those in denial of this terrible situation, to get real and quickly."
As an American I hope everyone stays safe and I'm massively disappointed in the toddler that's in charge here.
"Even the ones that think they have good intentions are annoying as fuck, still coming in here trying to make this thread about their shithole of a country

""I wish we took this as seriously""

"From somebody else who had it, is my guess."
5G is the only explanation. /s
"Could be anyone in the chain from managed isolation.  So airport staff, bus drivers,  security, nurses etc."
Managed ISO break (those dickhead who escaped) -> asymptomatic -> asymptomatic -> mild symptomatic -> these people?
No *direct* links. They may have contact with someone who has contact with somone at the border or similar.
"It'll be interesting to find out, that's for sure"
Contaminated mail order from overseas?
What if it was that guy who went to countdown a couple months ago?

Might go to level 4
Depends. If cases go up then maybe they go to level 4.
Or level 4.

"Not sure yet, more details to come in the morning, but while Auckland is in level 3 the rest of the country moves back up to level 2."
"Don't let that lead to a false sense of security. Masks can reduce the spread if you already have COVID, they won't stop you from picking it up."

"The place that I work, which was extremely kind about letting me stay home as I'm immunocompromised, will be forced to close if there's another lockdown in the area.

Fucking dreading it."
"Jesus, where do you work?"
Me too :/
"Everyone went back at level 2, food places were open at 3"

"https://covid19.govt.nz/updates-and-resources/latest-updates/new-zealands-alert-levels-are-changing-at-12-noon-on-wednesday-12-august/

>Under Alert Level 3, you are encouraged work from home if you can.

>Businesses are able to open, but should not physically interact with customers."
No.
I’m not sure but it’s definitely only essential workers this time.
I'd rather go back to level 4 lockdown than think of RoS
As it will.
No one's ever really gone
Are you in Auckland? All schools are closed for the rest of the week at least.
At Wintec. Haven’t heard anything atm. Find out tomorrow morning
I had my speaker hooked up to play rain sounds overnight and i fucking shit myself
Do you just have the day off or was there a reason it's a bit unreasonable? Kinda curious and I'm not terribly familiar with NZ. Sorry this hit /all
"I woke up at 5:45 for whatever reason, and was finally just about to fall back asleep. Guess I'm up for the day now, bloody hell."
"Me too buddy :( Partner's went off BEFORE we went to bed, luckily bastard!"
Jesus Christ harden up!
I got it at 11 am and 6 55 am then my actual alarm went off as I’m reading it which made me jump
Yeah what the hell.
It woke up at 10:30 last night and somehow managed to wake my 6 month old son up who sleeps down the hall.
So much for bringing back the lockdown sleep schedule
"At least you live in nz, not in USA. Try to always understand that it could de exponentially worst."
A lot of jobs in Auckland have to shut down at level 3 anyway.
"You’re allowed to leave Auckland if you don’t live their, but you’ve got to be extra careful"
"> If you are in Auckland and dont reside there typically, you can return home, but be careful."

"No, they specifically ruled that out."
"A bunch of tests have already come back negative, it's just the flu.

Source: Am in CHCH, have a Grandma."
"It's not hardly any cases, the infected are not even linked to isolation facilities, travels etc. It'll be likely to have infected 100s, just that no one knows."
Yes.  Honesty is one of the qualifications of the leaders we elect.
"Nothing happens in our country, because we ain't having no parties, no gatherings, no pissing around. 

Let's do it again, let's kick ass."
Level two have the party! If you have more than one hundred coming you might need to play favourites.
God I hope they prosecute the escapees to the maximum. Fuck those guys
"If they have a mandatory mask requirement, they got to make them easy to get hold of. My mum and I haven't noticed masks in stores through these past months. They should be available at the front of supermarkets and have signs in the window. On the news they didn't even mention where to get them."
"I'm hearing there is in Auckland, and it's recommended everywhere else."
Don't you worry about that
"So the season can't be completed? In that case, it must be null and void. The season officially did not happen.

-Sincerely, a Chiefs fan."
"They said it was too soon to call given this L3 announcement ends on Friday at midnight, but it's pretty much inevitable."
"Hard, bought tickets ages ago and have really been looking forward to it"
I came to say this.  New Zealand lockdown is fucking impressive.
"In my state, 1 in 550 people have died from Covid. It's a disaster."
Nah it’s more like the area that got it doesn’t put health and getting tested a priority. The alarming thing that set Ards off is that the case was found in a poor socioeconomic area and the community are high risk who can’t afford health. Shit can turn really bad really quickly with that combination. Shutting down is the right decision.
"Well here in the US, we're still screwing ourselves over so much that we could only dream of being able to track the single case you're currently seeing. As an american, I'm just ashamed of how bad the US is dealing with this virus.  As an american here in the US, I'm scared what will happen in the US if we don't all start giving a shit about others that live in the US."

Probably. He might even have some basic graphs to shuffle about as he falls over himself explaining
"Oh yeah like he told people of USA to not travel to NZ because we still have cases.
Such a weirdo."
"Whaaat Mt Albert??? That's so far out of the way for a South Auckland family, unless there's more positive results we haven't heard about yet."
What's that weird looking link?
So much false info flew around last time. I’m calling bullshit on everything unless I see proof. Hearsay means nothing right now sorry.
Time to brace ourselves for a second hit...
Really :/
Mt Albert Primary or Gladstone?
"Uh, the US has way more immunity. Doubly slow for New Zealand. And NZ is about to experience their first community spread. That's bad news because they will never leave lockdown."
Ugh. That show was awful. Everyone on it was disgusting. Why are we making an animal abuser famous?

"I was wondering about that - as soon as I saw the press conference I was assuming it was covid back in christchurch.

never expected auckland"
I understand those tests came back negative.
No. Not connected by the sound of it
rest of the world?? are you including *every* country except new zealand in that??
Yes. Thank god.
Yes
"Hand hygiene, masks if you can't physically distance, covid tracker app and don't panic :)"
"Wear a mask, get tested immediately if you develop any symptoms."
"No need to panic just yet unless you have symptoms. Wear masks, be cautious around family and friends, isolate if needs be. Keep up with the news. Get tested if you can."
"Making sure your contract tracing diary (locations, dates  times) is up to date. Contacting healthline if you have any symptoms.

Other than that - nothing."
"Odds are, you should be fine.

If you're not in Auckland anymore, just be mindful of your current health. Socially distance and wear a mask if you still need to go to work. Get tested immediately if you feel unwell."
Monitor your health. Consider wearing a mask if you must go out. If you get any symptoms get a test immediately.
"Be vigilant for symptoms, socially distance, get a test if you’re worried."
"Isolate immediately, call your doctor for a test, and tell everyone you’ve been in contact with that you’ve been in Auckland so they can act appropriately."
Isolate and get tested.
"Going to your local testing facility and getting tested, potentially also going into self-isolation until results are back."
Contact your gp and get a test
Staying home and get tested if you can.
"They said for Auckland it's recommended any time you leave your house, elsewhere it's recommended any place where it's difficult to social distance e.g. public transport"
"I would recommend it when in close proximity to other people, such as on public transport or in public buildings. Gloves (any kind - not just disposable latex/nitrile) aren't a bad idea too, since I find it far less likely that I'll accidentally touch my face when I'm wearing gloves - so much less likely to transmit something from a surface to my face.  
For me this means when going grocery shopping and/or whenever instructed by the RPH bods."
"We had it, past tense. Now we have it."
"I mean, it's super common to have flu outbreaks this time of year in resthomes."
"If another city was to close down, surely they would just move the whole country into that level of lockdown"

Thought the same thing! Throat is feeling awfully scratchy this evening...
Get a test mate.
Get a test.
Get a test
"Legit, not like they prevented thousands of deaths and people are like alive or anything.."
It's already obvious that we don't have to brag about it
I think so
"thanks, made me smile"
Why would you do that? I mean yea its safe but super gay..
It's 10:15 on a Tuesday. Go home.
the question is whether we should go back home
The answer to that question is always a 'yes'.
I'd play it safe and go for contactless delivery of your alcohol of choice
It's a Tuesday night you should have already been at the pub. It is quiz night. - but seriously the quiz pretty much ended when the news started fluttering around. Everyone was very somber and left quickly by the end of it.
Asking the vital questions in our time of national strife.
Yes!
Yes
Yes
"Yep, takeaways only, no dine in 

Chuck your mask on and support your local, they will appreciate it"
"Yes, I believe"
"Yes, with contactless pickup/delivery."
No but delivery is
Don't think so
[deleted]
Literally bought a box yesterday just because. Hopefully there isn't another run on sanitizer again
"Yes, they'll reassess. Basically, the main priorities now are to stop the spread and to find out where that person got it from. If they can find out, that should be good. If not, Level 2 might be extended, I imagine"
I will bet you any amount of money that level 3 will be in place after Friday.
"They need time to do contract tracing and determine where the link is. If the link is easily found and they think they’ve managed to put all possible contacts into isolation, the level will likely go down sometime after that. But I’m guessing it will be extended past Friday."
"I'd assume we could potentially go back to level one if they can successfully trace where these cases came from, as well as testing all close contacts of the current cases. If they can't figure out where the outbreak came from it's unlikely that we'll be going back to level one any time soon."
"I think if they find the source, they can take us to level 2, and then to 1 maybe even a few days after that.  If they don't find it, id say level 3 for a couple weeks"
You know as much as we do.
If by some absolute miracle they find 0 new cases in the next three days we might go to level 2 for a week would be my guess.
"Thanks for the explanations. :) it helped my jumbled thoughts haha. 

I get that it’s all uncertain at this point, it really sucks going back into that uncertainty when it felt like we were all feeling more positive!"
"American here, confirming national retardation. A third of my fellow citizens will vote for Donald Trump to receive a second term. Many of them refuse to wear masks. It’s a breathtaking (no pun intended) level of ignorance and stupidity."
"Being an American whose family begrudgingly accepts that the disease exists, while continuing to call the actual severity a hoax devised by Democrats, makes me want to bash my head off a wall."
They are trolls and likely not even American. Real American here wishing you all the best and hoping one day we can get our shit together and learn from those who weathered this thing.
"I know a lot of people here in America who don't even believe the virus is real. I'm not happy someone got sick, but I am glad y'all have a competent government who is jumping in to action to stop the spread."
"I given up on America, its turning into a nation I no longer want to live in. Hoping to move out of here when possible."
you act as if the american people are homogeneous
Sorry about my people. Some of us are trying!
"Had us in the first half, not gonna lie"
Holy shit that's huge. Feel sorry for you all up there! Good luck!
the rest of nz to go to level 2 for the same period too
Based on the excess deaths from other causes the CDC believes we already passed 200k
Probably not if you're American....
"Schools closed to students, but not at level 3 until 12 noon. You should be able to pick up your laptop etc tomorrow morning. (Not an authority, don't quote me)"

Can you get there and back before 12?
"Same. Got my laptop but don't have all my resources. Going to need to pop in tomorrow, methinks. Stay safe."

As an introvert this fucking sucks but........
It's not nice for us introverted folk either.
I hear ya
"Over in Ireland we developed a pretty decent one, I think it's gone out to other countries as an open source project so perhaps the NZ government can adopt that."
That tracer app doesn't work on my phone. It's not an ancient one either. Only bought it late 2017. My phone is a ***Samsung Galaxy J1.***
"What ?? The current one is fine.. I use it every day.  


A fucking cabbage could use it..   


Step 1 . Click ""Record a visit""  
Step 2 . Scan QR Code

&#x200B;

Easy."
"Or why not trace our phone’s gps locations, google does it."
Light that bud up!
Taxi home!
"It is not dormant. You are not seeing patient zero. Someone else infected him, we just don't know who.

Tests are often taken too late (or even too soon). Parts of the chain are likely asymptomatic. Perhaps the entire chain of infection."
People aren't getting tested when they show mild symptoms
I expect we’ll find out more details about the cause of the new cases over the next few days.
"Safety bias - people are so scared to ""ruin"" the streak they're hiding mild cases & not getting tested. Then someone gets too sick to hide it. See this kind of thing in places proud of their workplace safety records all the time."
"Someone mentioned in another thread that air crew are still traveling and are not required to be quarantined. 

There’s no link to AC at this time, but it’s not like the island is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

NZ: I’m proud of you and your citizens for harbouring an environment, at least in regards to crisis response related to this pandemic, for the government to be able to act quickly and in line with science."
"There's thousands of people entering NZ daily still who are NZ citizens who live / work overseas returning home as it's safe comapred to the rest of the world. 

Each person is put into an isolation facility for 2 weeks and require two negative tests to be released. My guess is that someone at these facilities tested someone returning who was positive and picked it up from them. Then they didn't show symptoms but was a carrier when leaving etc. 

There's cases in NZ, but in these facilities. This is concerning as it's a community transfer (i.e. someone who didn't travel back / traveled). Means there's a breach as what we know as of now is that it doesn't linger for this long."
"More likely a positive case that was returning from overseas gave it to someone before they got into managed isolation, and the virus spread from there. They haven't identified the source case yet, but that would be my guess."
No community transmission. We have cases in managed isolation but there have been a few breaches of that. Perhaps it came from that somehow?
A steady stream of people coming back into the country and current practices not being strict enough
"I'd wager it's likely that someone else received the case abroad and remained an asymptomatic carrier. At some point, that person transferred the virus to the case in the OP."
"Could this possibly related to 1 imported case found in Malaysia? Malaysia has 9 new cases today, 5 of them are imported cases. 1 of those is from someone flying in from New Zealand. Malaysian authorities could have contacted the New Zealand counterparts.  Contact tracing tests then uncover this new outbreak. 

The reverse of this happened to Malaysia back in March. Brunei detected a case from someone coming back from Malaysia. Malaysian authorities were noted. Subsequent contact tracing then uncovered what later proved to be the largest ever cluster of Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia."
"No, its that the VAST majority of people who get it never even show a symptom. I have seen reports saying over 80% of those who get it never show a symptom. Most likely it was just silently spreading the whole time."
I checked yeast and flour. We good!
"Well, the level 3 lockdown in Auckland and level 2 everywhere else are both set to end midnight Friday, but if the source still hasn't been found it might take longer"
"they can't track down a 2 generation link, the virus has been out for at least a week.

At best we're gonna be in this state for 3 weeks at worst same as the first time.

trying not to be too optimistic or pessimistic"
It’s the 5 days the dude has had symptoms I’m worried about. To be fair to him who hasn’t had a cold lately? I wouldn’t have thought Covid either if no personal links to isolation facilities or airlines.
It will all be sorted tomorrow morning
No messing about is comforting.
Same (though in US). The cost of living in NZ just doesn’t make it feasible to return at the moment and neither does the risk of travel. Grateful that everyone in our bubble gets to remote for the foreseeable future. Already planned to go home year after next for extended period so fingers crossed / for me and for us all. Stay safe over there.
"Yeah, everyone makes fun of the U.S. for never leaving the first wave, but many places should now be bracing for the second wave."
I don't get it. I'm in houston with hundreds of new cases every day and I can guarantee nearly nobody here is taking it even as close to as seriously as y'all. 4 cases and everything shuts down? The karens would have a field day. It's so depressing. Wish I lived somewhere that actually cared about its people.
"All I see in this thread are Americans justifiably embarrassed about the situation, and desperate for the world to abandon us."

"Alert Level 2 — Reduce
The disease is contained, but the risk of community transmission remains.

Risk assessment
Household transmission could be occurring.
Single or isolated cluster outbreaks.
Range of measures that can be applied locally or nationally
People can reconnect with friends and family, and socialise in groups of up to 100, go shopping or travel domestically if following public health guidance.

Keep physical distancing of 2 metres from people you don’t know when out in public or in retail stores. Keep 1 metre physical distancing in controlled environments like workplaces, where practical.

No more than 100 people at gatherings, including weddings, birthdays, funerals and tangihanga.
Businesses can open to the public if following public health guidance including physical distancing and record keeping. Alternative ways of working are encouraged where possible.

Hospitality businesses must keep groups of customers separated, seated and served by a single person.
Maximum of 100 people at a time in a defined space.
Sport and recreation activities are allowed, subject to conditions on gatherings, record keeping, and physical distancing where practical.

Public venues such as museums, libraries and pools can open if they comply with public health measures and ensure 1 metre physical distancing and record keeping.
Event facilities, including cinemas, stadiums, concert venues and casinos can have more than 100 people at a time, provided there are no more than 100 in a defined space, and the groups do not mix.
Health and disability care services operate as normally as possible.

It is safe to send your children to schools, early learning services and tertiary education. There will be appropriate measures in place.
People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, for example those with underlying medical conditions, especially if not well-controlled, and older people, are encouraged to take additional precautions when leaving home. They may work if they agree with their employer that they can do so safely."
"Gatherings limit, washing your hands, keep track of your contact"
Social distancing and good hygiene but likely with added masks.
And we ain’t talking hot n spicy KFC or the Kiwiburger.
"Ehhh, might be trying your luck. There's a Ministry of Health hotline you can call about these issues."
In your shoes I would consider bussing or driving to Welly instead. But  obviously that can be pricey/tricky to arrange at short notice.
You're allowed to return home
You would probably have to be early there might be a lot of covid test
Physically print your ticket and go early.  You can only try.
"Uhh, I suppose technically it's going into lockdown at 12pm so maybe if you can get there before? Not sure though, need more info."
"They were talking about sealing various parts of the airport for a possible bubble with other countries so maybe they can go ahead and implement that.  

Whether or not they can do that by tomorrow night is another story."
"Most probably direct or second degree contact with someone who works in isolation facilities, the airport, or airlines."
"It's gonna be like influenza, comes and goes, every winter. But I ain't Ashley, I'm Jon, I know nothing. Nada."
I mean you are probably right we suck
Exactly this. There's are a ton of Americans crossing into Canada still. in BC any American caught in a sightseeing in a provincial park CA. Be fined. Stay out would ya eh
"Yeah we know, you don’t need to rub it in...."
"That’s the point duh, it’s like other countries are acting like they’ve never seen a corrupt government before and instead labeling the people affected by it as “incompetent.” Literally trying to get him out ASAP. But keep acting like you’re not reading how he’s abusing power"
"I’ve not seen one comment by Americans trying to downplay what NZ did, what I have seen is countless Americans saying “good job” or some other stupid shit like that"
Not going to argue with that at all. I am jealous and I do wish our leadership wasn’t garbage. Most of the world is being responsible and were drowning in our own stupidity. It’s embarrassing.
We've had it the easiest here out of anybody. Our initial lockdown time + this 3 days (and any possible extra) is nothing compared to a lot of other countries.
"C'mon, we've had an awesome run. Try living just about anywhere else in the world right now and have some real problems."
I believe I said this in like the 4th month of 2020 too *sigh*
Come to the UK where lockdown never really lifted and they're still debating about what to actually do...
"Do you guys seriously not sleep with Do Not Disturb on? 

I got the alert but no sound because of this."
I thought they may have finally found Madeline McCann
11:35pm and 6:55am for me.
"No one is panicking. People are taking this seriously to make the situation recoverable as fast as possible. Otherwise you are just prolonging the situation like an idiot.

For the first week, you want tough measurers, not relaxed in order to help contract tracing team get a grip on the situation. Every day counts."
Hmmm how'd they get it though?
"> 1  in every 5 confirmed infection need hospitalisation

So the next case gets sick as fuck? Rough."
[deleted]
The shops will stay open throughout. You'll be okay. Just remember your mask
"Yeah, it’s best to wait a bit, if everybody floods, then there’s a greater risk of spread."
I believe health services can still operate at level 3. Check with your provider to be sure.
Health services dont stop during lockdown. You migh be swapped to an online appt though
I feel you. I did 7 months in cast with lockdown in the middle. Would not recommend.
Aye I feel that. My birthday is on Friday and I had all this stuff planned for me and my partner to do to celebrate. Never mind I guess....
Thank you for thinking about cancelling. Thank you for being smart. We're all affected here and I'm loving your kindness for others right now :)
"Had a trip up to Welly planned for this weekend to celebrate graduating myself, just a lil disappointing ae"
Might be suffering from a rush of signups overloading the servers. Try again a bit later.
"mine did that, I left it for a couple of mins and it randomly worked"
What email are you using sometimes it does not come though gmail fast enough
Worked for me
Yeah same thing have gotten 4 new codes and non have been accepted
America can't pass up the opportunity to talk about themselves
"Well, yeah. The US is the epicenter."
Americans on an American website? That is absolute insanity.
"It was the blaring emergency alert on my phone after 10pm that really set the mood to ""heart attack"". That's short notice to realise my work trip today won't be happening. I figure they are worried about how far it has spread to only give us overnight 12 hrs heads up. Last time we had 48 hrs to shift gears."
Bootlicker
Scumlords.
Absolutely. What a shit time to do a rent hike. I would tell them as much.
"If you're happy with potentially ~6% of the country losing their job so you can delay, not even get out of, paying your rent you're a selfish dickhead"
That’s a good question as we’re on one now...
No gatherings over 100. Same level 2 rules as before. Unless you are Auckland in which case its go home stay home
Sorry we should amend this. You should be at home unless your an essential worker or kfc
Yeah it's pretty vague. I'm a builder doing a kitchen reno for a client. They've got no kitchen at all. How am I supposed to do that from home?
Or transmissionless symptoms ...
People bloody running away from quarantine
And how easy would that be to do? Hmmmmm...
The Americans are coming the Americans are coming!
"Yeah, I don't need to be here right now"
Please don't. Some of us are dual citizens and want to keep up with what's happening back home.
"""Only we're allowed to shit on Americans at literally every possible opportunity, not the other way around."""
"American here - please do not ban us. Many of us want to learn from your ways. We need someone, somewhere, to show us the way. Thank you and stay safe. Cheers."
" The advice has stayed the same this whole time. Stay home and call healthline/ your doctor and take their advice.

No need to make a judgement call yourself."
"Get tested.

Edit to OP's edit - no judgement on where you're at, but give healthline a call and see what they say now.

https://covid19.govt.nz/updates-and-resources/contact-a-helpline/"
Honestly get tested bro. As soon as you get symptoms
This is why youve been told for months to get tested.
In Auckland. Husband was sick for 3 weeks with bad cold. I got chest pains during same time. We both asked for covid test and was told no.
"Why did you not get tested? They’ve been begging the public over and over again if you have symptoms call healthline and get tested. This complacency and “no community transmission, it can’t be Covid” attitude has just screwed us over again."
Yeah well they never stopped telling you to take cold and flu symptoms seriously...
Are you on Etsy? I was going to get some tomorrow lol. Bet they are all gone by the time I finish work!
This is new level 3 only essential  services and kfc
"[From the nz covid website:](https://covid19.govt.nz/covid-19/restrictions/alert-system-overview/)

> People must work from home unless that is not possible.

So you can do non-essential work but only if not possible from home, and only if you don't have to interact with customers.

> Businesses can open premises, but cannot physically interact with customers."
"Different rules for Auckland, that the rest of NZ. Please read the article."
It’s likely Testing will go crazy and we’ll have 40+ confirmed cases by next week- So best we stay home and get tested if we’re feeling sick aye
I think we'll end up staying at level 3 in Auckland for at least a couple weeks. Curious to hear what everyone else thinks
Im sure you guys will crush it in no time again. Good luck you Kiwis.
"3 days after L3, just like last time."
They have no connection at all to the airport or isolation hotels :(
MonkaW
"As an American, it makes ME cringe when other Americans make fun of a country that had an absolutely  incredible Covid19 response. 

I wish you well in Mexico. I've seen numbers rising there too :/"
That's my feelings about it.
"Actually, it doesn't."
Yeah you should have to pass an IQ test to be let back in the country
"Strap your tinfoil tighter to your head
Edit: he added the /s"
Wonder what the results will say. Keep us posted for that sweet karma.
"Yeah I had a test this weekend for flu symptoms with chest pains - Healthline told me to go immediately. I haven't been in contact with anyone who would've had it (just public transport wankers coughing and sneezing on fucking everything). I haven't got my results back yet, but now that we have cases I'm a little worried. The weirdest thing about this cold/flu is that it literally hit within 2 hours of me arriving at work totally fine. By midday I had to go home and collapse in bed crazy sick, absolutely no lead in time like a normal sickness like this."
Are you in the Auckland region?
"Some idiot here in the U.S. literally said to me the other day, and I quote, ""Come November third this will all just disappear"" along with a hand movement. I'm so torn between pushing for greater focus on increased help and support for our nation's apparently significant population of mentally deficient morons and simply pretending they don't exist when they are talking. I'm 100% sure the guy mistook the patient, condescending, pitying look on my face for agreement."
"Along with what that person said, your best bet may be to simply call Healthline"
If there is one it might be on covid19.govt.nz
Can you not just call your local medical centre? That’s all I did and got a test the following morning.
Wouldn't pin your hopes on it
Gatherings are limited to 100 under level 2
"We're here now, it's ok, we know we can do it so let's do it. Save lives, kick ass, all by washing hands and being healthy. Fuck yeah, let's do this thing! 

So excited to do my part tomorrow!"
"They've probably had contact with someone that they haven't managed to trace yet, maybe someone who was asymptomatic, like a health worker, someone at one of the quarantine hotels etc."
You can travel to and from Auckland if you are returning home.
"Inter-regional travel is limited to essential workers, so you should be fine.

Good luck with flights mate. Hopefully they'll let you take what would've been holiday flights
Look after yourself buddy
Go get tested.
What make you say that?
You oughta get tested bud.
"Perhaps get yourself tested tomorrow, especially since you go to the same gym, better to be safe than sorry! 👍🏼"
If you are being serious please share more info with us?
haha nice way to portray your enthusiasm about ACTION
She is the one who fucked up quarantine of arrivals.
I felt the same. Only bright spot in this shitty situation.
How on earth is at least Bloomfield's back a win win?
"Yea, real win win situation idiot. Glad you’re happy to get your cringe fix while 4 people have a serious disease and businesses take further losses. 

But oh my gawd Bloomfield though right."
Source?
Yeah because foreign diplomats have regular close contact with 7 person South Auckland households...
We're ok. We have good people in the right places and kiwis know if we follow the plan we can nip this in the bud.
"Like they said, we have a plan. We can get through this, mate."
You'll be right matey. Im currently living under stage 4 restrictions plus a 8pm-5am curfew in Melbourne and it aint as bad as it seems

"I think they're not used to masks in NZ because they beat it the first time before masks were really a thing.

I would certainly recommend face coverings if you have one available. There is no downside except for looking stupid. You can look up how to tie a T-shirt so it fits over your mouth and nose."
That’s what I thought of lol
Yup. Non essential. Going in tomorrow morning to pack up tools and close down our sites for the week.

Better practice your swimming
"Surely almost certainly, Auckland needs to isolate from rest of nz.

Sorry shit situation for you to be in

Edit: non residents are allowed to leave apparently"
Call in the morning.
I'll sell ya my boat If ya want.
I am going to say yes.
"pretty sure the airport is an essential service, therefore open at all levels"

I just counted 4 people laughing at them before I got to your comment and I just got into this thread. And the one directly below is bashing them.
"Exactly what I was thinking. 

Rather than a country where people lick produce on camera for social media likes?

Rather than a country where people refuse to do what they’re told due to “freedoms”?

Rather than a country where leadership, really of any sort, at any level, anywhere, seems to be something to sadly read about in the history books?

Fuckin me too fam."
"I have worn a mask since the first week of March before quarantine/lock down, told my family to wear masks in public DESPITE the Surgeon Gen saying they ""don't work"", have only been inside the grocery store 4 times since March, was told by my boss that I'd have to be present at work because I'm ""young and healthy, you'll be fine"" while others work from home, haven't done anything at ALL except walk around outside and be in my house outside of work. I'm tired, but I'm still gonna continue doing it because it's the right thing."
Lucky I do
"Same here. We don't deserve it, though... and wouldn't even opt for it if were a choice, I'm afraid. 

The rest of the world, however, deserves for US to not be as douchy as we are."
I don’t think 1-4 covers an outbreak of full USA...
Apply to Kezza
"Nobody cares, go away please."
"It's not one case, it's four. 

They have had it for a while so I am sure others have it too. This is a new cluster and as we have found out before a single cluster can result in hundreds of cases."
"We must build a wall around Auckland, and make them pay for it"
"Not only one case, I'm afraid :("
It's at least five cases - four in the household and whoever they got it from. Likely more though.
And apparently we are on the standby for level 4. It could go up there soon if matters get worse
"Same for me...     
but I'm still watching it all unfold like....bruh"
"Off topic, but during the first wave, a dog once got off leash and was chasing me and my dog for a solid minute."
"Cats, Dogs and Minks are the 3 ive seen so far."
"Bats, probably."
"No but don't you understand, America is completely and utterly different from every single other country on the planet...so you literally cannot use any of them as a comparison."
"NZ has 5 million people.... USA has 320 million people
  
you dumbass."
I live here and I don't blame you.
Ay man North Shore is alright :(
This. The level 3 announcement is the most important title.
"That’s one way of looking at it. ANOTHER way is that the muppet did the right thing and got himself checked and thus doing us ALL a favour.

Don’t hate the person. Hate the virus. Hate the fact that there’s people who are coming into New Zealand and not following process and procedures we have in place. 

This guy is good. It’s a shame they will be bashed online though."
I'm no scientist but it seems incredibly unlikely. It'd have to have remain undetected for 7+ full cycles.
"I dunno, it's not impossible but hard to imagine covid just kind of wandering around with a few infected people here and there. It's pretty rampant isn't it?"
How long does this virus live outside the body?
"I expect to see more calls for a total closure of the border, citizens included."
"I've had several coworkers (and managers) talk about how if it comes back they're not willing to go through another lockdown. 

I'm not looking forward to the divisions that may be coming .."
I'm mad already
"Been talking to my friends tonight since announced - every one of them more than willing to comply - sad, shocked, resigned. Mix of emotions. I hope most people just do what we need to do."

Turns out it was a game of two halves.
Jacinda
I would check with the airline. Jacinda mentioned that only Auckland residents are allowed back in.
Do you live in Auckland?
It doesn't take affect till midday tomorrow so chances are they'll be wheels down by then.
They mentioned a roadblock. Nothing about an air block though.
"From the post

>Travelling in and out of Auckland is prohibited. If you are in Auckland and dont reside there typically, you can return home, but be careful."
"If you do come back please be super careful, just on the slightest chance you have it."
"From Auckland? If you live outside Auckland, you're allowed to leave, it's just asked that you're very mindful of your health."
if it's home then yes
I was supposed to fly to gisborne Thursday morning im guessing we can't
"I'd say this is correct. Who legitimately knows the percentage of asymptomatic carriers. There could feasibly be dozens out roaming NZ, and no one would know."
"Two local schools in my area just opened last week. Both of them closed again by Friday, and today one of them has reopened, with a student testing positive. 

And NZ locks down a large area over three cases...

Wonder why this Hoax won’t stop spreading?"
[deleted]
I am surprised I haven't seen more responses like this
New Zealand has no land borders.
As an American I feel bad for the people of New Zealand. They’ve been convinced by their government that eradication of a highly transmissible virus is not only possible (it isn’t) but also that it is a goal worth pursuing regardless of the cost.
"Where there are 4, there are certainly 100 more. And then it was 200. And then it was 2,000."
must be coincidence or something idk
Its far to early to go back to school i don't know why they insist on in person learning so much we don't even have a vaccine to covid and there's 5 million cases plus. This is just insane
It was inevitable
"They've been saying for weeks that there was a very high chance something would slip through and that we needed to be prepared. I don't think we've been cocky at all. Now is the time to prove that not only did our immediate response plan work, but our resurgence response plan is effective too."
"Yeah but don’t like,*go and check on them* Call them."
102 days isn't that soon
We were lucky to have a break from it at all
From Auckland?
Best be canceling and having a party at a later date 🙂
If you were working last time as essential then you'll probably have to work this time too. Reckon you can enquire/lay a complaint with MoH/Business if you think your business is not actually deemed essential and are trying to game the system though.
The same things that defined essential the first time we did this?
"Excluding food service and public venues you're allowed to open but should work at home if possible, have to distance if not, and can't interact directly with customers.

https://covid19.govt.nz/covid-19/restrictions/auckland/

>Businesses are able to open, but should not physically interact with customers.

>Essential services including healthcare, justice services and businesses providing necessities are able to open.

>Bars and restaurants should close, but takeaways are allowed."
Still amazes me that people like your boss can only think of their bottomline at a time like this.
Someone lied.
"A. It was still spreading but not well enough to have any detection. Could be lots of asymptomatic cases or very mild cases

B. Some sailor or person who had to do essential international work did not quarantine well enough

C. Combination of the above"
"Itd someone lying about a quarantining, or maybe breaking it momentarily thinking ""What's the harm?"" 

It's people, people are shitty and spread the virus."
It's almost like one of them isn't being quite truthful. At least that makes much more sense than the covid being magic.....
I don't typically believe in conspiracy theories but covid might change my mind. The transmission of this disease is a mystery and countries like Pakistan with a not so good healthcare infrastructure and no strict lockdown restrictions have somehow managed to flatten the curve while many others haven't. Similarly this New Zealand case out of nowhere . Doesn't make sense.
"It's far more likely that they just didn't have any serious cases.  The media and internet hype covid up to be this disease that is going to incapacitate every and anyone.   They say 30% are asymptomatic, but thats only just the people that have been tested as a precaution.  That number is probably far far higher than we believe it to be.  The rest of the cases break into mild cough to common flu symptoms.  Very few cases actually get hospitalized and an much smaller amount die from it. 

This disease isn't a mystery.  It's insanely contagious.  It's not very lethal.  The likelihood that it was presenting and spreading around New Zealand as a simple cough is pretty high."
"Ironically, I've already seen comments from FB ""friends"" saying they won't vote for Labour now that they've done this. Can't win!"
Ye just looking at how much caution is taken over ONE SINGLE FAMILY and in the meanwhile US has how many hundreds of new cases per day?
"As an American, I talked to my Australian friend a few weeks ago who told me her entire region had like 20 cases. 

*Cries in Floridian hospital worker*"
"I heard from a friend who is a cop at 8pm.  The Cops were informed before Judith.  It could of easily come from them.  

Take your hating elsewhere.  Now is the time for kindness"
Stop politicising this.
"I just got back into the swing of things at uni, it’s such a disruption having classes cancelled. It was also so much better being back on campus instead of online"
"as a third year student covid has been problematic in niggly ways to me but honestly in many ways has been great. presentations are the one thing i can’t do so being able to do massive third year presentations over zoom that i have been dreading for years and thought could possibly stop me getting my degree has been pretty sweet. 

ive kept my grades up to and found myself doing a lot more research because you are self guiding so much more. 

the teething issues with lecturers being unprepared can be annoying. but outside of any lockdown i feel like a mixture of both face to face and online could be a good way to teach if it works going forward. 

different for every one though"
And the students who struggle with online learning. I know I wouldn’t have the motivation.
"Right? At least we are not in as bad of a place as AUT who've put in a block course system. I had to miss giving my presentation last week because I had a sore throat and was waiting for my covid swab to come back. Figures, I'll be doing it via Zoom tomorrow anyway..."
what's culture kings?
Do we have one in Auckland?
"hard and fast, just like in the bedroom"
I'm fuckin dreading that nonsense
A mate just posted about the plandemic
163k vs 22 dead. Me too 🙃.
I think I heard her say from 12 noon tomorrow
12pm (noon) tomorrow.
"I think 12:00 is for tomorrow midday?

Edit: yep it’s noon tomorrow"
12:00 is midday
Midday on Wednesday 12th August.
Believe it was midday tomorrow.
They just said noon tomorrow.
I'd assume it's in 24 time so that would be noon tomorrow.
Midday tomorrow.
"it's not 12 hours from anything, it's at 12 midday."
Get onto cancelling things.  Might still be able to get some money back
"Yeah, we're under 'stay at home unless you're essential' etc. Sorry mate, you'll have to wait and see what happens, and rebook."
"Nope.

Thats canned."
"Jesus, people doing that are likely the reason we have covid!!"
"Vote for conservative nut jobs, die for conservative nut jobs."
Same thing in Alberta
As a kiwi I really like that song Manitoba by Daniela Andrade. Lovely.
It highlights the need for widespread testing even with zero deaths and cases in a country.
Or we need to stop letting people in.
TVNZ cut right as someone in the seats opened their mouth.
One news did that lol
Implying Americans are even sheltering in place lmao.
">Envious

You, and millions of Americans should be completely pissed off! 

We have spent billions in research and preparedness, and our sitting president threw it all in the Trash. --Just a small portion of the amouont of tax money that we have paid, only to receive lip-service and wallstreet/bank bailouts. 

If you are not pissed about your tax dollars exploiting you, just wait, there is more to come."
I mean it's a little easier when your entire country is the size of Colorado.
Because people don't stay still. Especially apparently people with covid who apparently have to travel as much and as far as possible.
Because we don’t know where the virus got in or how far it’s travelled. It’s three days to try to work that out.
Because there is community transmission in the population
To give the govt. time to figure out the extent of spread
"People fly in and out of Auckland everyday. People who live in Whangarei, Hamilton and Tauranga also frequently travel to Auckland and back for work...You can't just take half measures in a situation like this. Melbourne tried that and it was a disaster."
"Probably because of the possibility of transmission to other regions. It's low, but possible."
Level 1 is the loosest - level 4 being the most restricted.
"Presumably in case someone with covid has travelled outside of Auckland, even being asymptomatic. So if other regions have unidentified cases it’s better to be safe and keep away from each other to prevent further spread"
Thousands of people move in and out of Auckland daily.
2 is lower than 3
L3 is stricter than L2.
Because we have regular domestic travel. Lots of people taking holidays around the country or travelling for work.
I think you've interpreted the level system wrong. The rest of the country is under less strict restriction compared to Auckland. Level 4 is the strictest of the levels (not level 1).
"Pretty sure there shouldn't be a problem with him returning, he will just have to quarantine as usual"

"Has humanity really fallen off that far that we're using death tolls as a dick measuring contest? 

Not defending the ""get rekt"" comments going on in this thread but takes like these are a part of the problem."
"Holy shit, learn what a paragraph is,
It will make people actually read your post...

Rather than just ignore it."
"I would think so, since the virus can stay on surfaces especially plastic for a couple of days or more (at least a lot viruses can do so, so I’m assuming that’s the case for corona too). If y’all ever order something, wait a day or two to open it unless it’s necessary, and clean the package if you can."
It's like this virus is sentinent and working out how to hide. Stay low in the kids and strike.
"I don't agree because you only need one person to show symptoms to be aware of the cluster, and at that point there can only be 5-10 total people infected at most. As long as you're doing contact tracing and mandatory quarantine for all contacts until they're tested, given the period of time before becoming contagious, you can suppress or extinguish the disease while the size of the outbreak is small."
I wonder if there's something else at play here. It possibly lays dormant waiting for the right conditions
Cooking is both not complicated and literally a mandatory life skill. You're on the internet to leave this comment so there's no excuse not to learn. Youtube.
Look on youtube/ google how to cook and prepare basic meals
Supermarkets do premade meals. Like 5 minutes in a microwave and they're ready to eat. Frozen pies... microwave or oven. There is so much premade ready to eat or make in 5 minutes meals out there. Steamed vege packs. 2 minute noodles. I would recommend some premade supermarket meals not necessarily the best but a premade lasagna heated and eaten is better than more nutritionally poor noodles...
"Not being able to cook isn't an excuse. Learn it's really not hard.

Look at recipe, follow the instructions."
"just go to a super market and eat baked beans and shit, no one could fuck that up"
Learn to cook then. It's fun and beats starvation
"You suck at cooking yeah you totally suck...



...is the channel on YouTube made for you"
"I can't cook either, but a slow cooker makes it look like I can."
"Mate that's not good reward for saving lives, if it's any help here's an idea food parcels are available through various vendors, to be honest frozen meals are a neat trick not store bought. Google frozen meals nz. Works out to be 10 bucks a meal and good for any time tbh got me through a patch. All sorts of options. Honestly they are not great but way more nutritious than the usual slop. Seasoning helps."

Cooking can be really simple. Doesn't have to be complicated. If you like rice get a rice cooker and it's as simple as adding water.
Look on Facebook for 'Nat's What I Reckon'. He does great entertaining (and achievable!) cooking videos!

It’ll be a quarantine breach
Or people who were positive didn’t know and/ or didn’t get tested.
"Unfortunately, we can't legally prevent citizens from coming back."
"Why? If more cases are going to pop up, surely it would be better to happen when we're already in partial lockdown?"
Yes please!
"No more people forever.

Especially after spitting into face who lived here for years with work visas."
So ass holes like me who work in IT can get everything ready for the huge influx of homeworkers
So people like us can go into the office and grab hardware or whatever to take home for WFH
"Business continuity. People need to get their laptops, weather proof construction sites for 5 days etc"
Gives time for people to prepare. You should take precautions as if level 3 is in place though.
"I just got to Auckland at 6pm for work. Gotta allow me
to get back home to Tauranga mate I ain’t staying up here 😂😂😂"
"They're ""managing"" the messaging so people don't just throw their toys and refuse to do it. It's no accident they announced it quite late after most shops had closed for the night.

TBH I think they've known for about 10 days. They restarted the COVID ads on TV the Sunday before last, and have been talking about masks all the time since then. They were trying to ease people into it again.

Same with this ""3 day"" lockdown, it ain't going to be 3 days, that would make no sense. But they're trying to ease us all into it to avoid panic, anger and riots."
"I hate living here. I've had enough, if the world's gonna end I refuse to live among the dumbest fucks who dragged us down. I'd do anything if I knew how someone as young as me could get out"
"Yeah no they don't get exceptions. It wouldn't make sense anyway, no real economic benefit to letting individual artists into the country.
You're confusing with the Avatar filming crew that came to Wellington."
"Everyone that has been arriving has been put in government paid hotel quarantine facilities - yes over 30,000 or so had come in since first lockdown, but they’ve all been quarantined and tested. 
(Just recently they’ve started to charge people for quarantine costs if its a kiwi that’s going on holiday and returning and I think business trips)"
"Fuck they took it seriously you fuck. That’s WHY they went and GOT TESTED. 

This guy is a good cunt. He did the right thing."
"Pretty sure 99.9% of people are taking it seriously, relax."
Um I’m sorry we were one of the first countries to lock down and close borders
"Settle down mate. It’ll be fine, okay"
We did take it seriously. Someone in charge of the border let us all down
What's level 2?
"Dont forget all those BLM protests . They cant have helped. Good cause or not, that was dumb."
Southern California I take it?
"The christchurch rest home situation is likely just regular flu, rest homes often isolate their residents if there is an outbreak of anything among the residents. I have no doubt they will get tested quicksmart to confirm"
You should ask yourself what the value of such speculation is eh? Is it serving any purpose or is it just making people feel worse for no reason...
Maybe the game will be played with no spectators
The breakdance....
Nooooooo.
"Or, it's likely that the virus acts like a dormant carrier in some people and that person happened to interact with someone in this family.  There's a lot not yet known about this virus."
Someone *somewhere* allowed the infection to resurface.  There is no reason to accuse any of the family of lying.  NZ has been clear ad people aren't quarantined like in the past.  Someone brought it in and this poor family got it from them.
"That would be the *good* option, which is horrifying."
"Keep in mind that the virus can be carried by many types of animals, so it could be an animal transmission."
you have to agree that you are now considerably more alerted than you were asleep
Not even 7:34am and Judith Collins decides to interrupt everyone after 4 hours of finally sleeping with a vacous blame game interview about answers she deserves. RNZ = disabled.

"Exactly what an Australian expert on ABC a few hours ago was saying should happen if there was a resurgence in NZ, based on their local failure of postcode lockdowns."
Source?
"No idea why you're being downvoted, you're exactly right."
"Where exactly is the border of ""Auckland""?"
"Some people who have flown into NZ and were required to quarantine had escaped for brief times, but went to public areas. So my best guess is that’s the reason for the spread. We had one dude a few weeks ago (maybe a month?) who went to a supermarket in the middle of the city, took selfies there, went and did phone calls at Starbucks, and then refused to tell police where he went for the extra 45 minutes they couldn’t find him. I’m not sure if he what tested positive, but I wouldn’t be surprised if a positive patient had escaped and went into the public."
"At this stage its unknown how it happened, hence lockdown again. Contract tracing has been done but so far no link to any overseas isolators or border staff has been found. Either there's a link the family isint telling MOH staff about or this was a freak accident with somebody else infected out there who doesn't know they are also infected."
"That's what the lockdown is for. Allow them to contact trace, find the source and get ahead of the virus transmission. 

Also we are not covid free, we have cases in managed isolation which is just people who have come in from overseas"
I don’t find it confusing. I think it not insignificant that this is apparently located in South Auckland. That’s where the international airport is. My best guess is someone connected to quarantine (hotel transport or airport worker) picked it up from an incoming 14 day quarantine traveler (these are the only known cases - incoming travelers) and then popped down to the local Countdown or whatever and passed it on.
"40% of the homeless population in California were asymptomatic carriers.

If you're healthy, it's *really easy* to have (and spread) COVID without knowing about it. So, as they widen the net, they might find someone that has it but shows no symptoms. [It might relate to vitamin D deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266578/)"
I wonder what mail was coming in from outside the country? Did it sit for a few weeks before being delivered? Wasn't there something about cardboard that cover stayed on longer? Or am I thinking of something else?
seems like that’s the confusing bit
"Could be an animal reservoir. Cats can carry the virus, presumably other animals as well."
His mistress just got back from somewhere.
Immaculate conception.
"Symptomatic for 5 days - not good.

South Auckland makes me think it sneaked out of Quarantine with a staff member?"
Tested twice and swabbed twice. Family members positive too. Not a false positive.
"Yeah, with our really great quarantine management of returning NZers...

So many exemptions"
People are dumb... It's a stretch but it doesn't surprise me.
With 4 of them testing positive and symptoms I doubt it.
It's confusing because I write it as people say it during a press conference then I go to bed. But I agree it was confusing and I've gone back and tidied some of the language now.
You can write coherent sentences which collectively make sense.  Unfortunately today's journalists cannot.
I agree. We’re buying time until the availability of a vaccine. That’s the plan
"Eradicated globally? No. Eliminated locally? Yeah, that’s quite probably where we were at for the last 90 days, give or take. 

It seems pretty unlikely that every single case keeping the chain of transmission going was asymptomatic over that period, and that *none* of the symptomatic ones got picked up given the level of testing and how happy everyone was to get back to the rugby and bars... it would have bounced back quickly if it was just lurking out there. 

I’m betting it’s slipped in again via the quarantine facilities that are actually just hotels, or aircrew, etc...  but it’s concerning that there are no clear links to that with these cases. Could mean it’s been (re) circulating for a little while."
"We're eliminating risk, not eradicating. The term doesn't make sense when you could be reinfected at any time like this"
"It would but the rest of the world is too pussy.

Even some of our own citizens are too pussy. The cunts."
"Agree. Unfortunately there are downsides to New Zealands success. I feel many Kiwis are not prepared for covid coming back, given the country has done such a great job. The rest of the world is suffering big time, many of us are five months in to various degrees of lockdown. Many of us are used to the new measures, and wearing a mask is second nature. 

NZ has been shielded from the worst of it (so far). Implementing tougher restrictions again, and even making mask wearing mandatory will be hard for many Kiwis to swallow when they have ""sacrificed so much"". 

Covid was always going to get back into NZ. At least now I assume the country has had five months to ensure hospitals are fully equipped for what is to come.

Edit: to add that I think NZ's response has been admirable and many countries could learn from the way they handled it. There will always be pros and cons. I just hope Kiwis can be a little more accepting of the inevitable and not take it too hard. You guys did a good job."

Woah wait what? Fake news from the democrats? you know who the president is right?
Seriously?
I hadn't heard of anything like that happening. Do you have a link to an article or something?
No they aren't being released til they test negative after 14 days.
"Not sure yet, which is why we are locking down the city for 3 days. The family who've tested positive haven't been overseas and they don't work at the border or in the isolation facilities."
No one knew yet
"They weren't going to announce until they had a confirmed positive test.

But they were probably aware that there was a risk from some time today."
Not necessarily.
"Categorical statements from Jacinda and Ashley:

&#x200B;

Jacinda was notified at 4pm.

Ashley received a text just before 3pm."
Honestly it's been fun being a little smug. It was going to happen eventually.

* being able to deliver to small clusters of up to 500 voters affected by local Alert Levels 3 or 4, to a maximum of 5,000 voters nationwide, using takeaway voting. 

If an outbreak occurs during the voting period, there are some emergency powers available to the Chief Electoral Officer to delay election day voting by up to seven days at a time."""
Nothing. I would presume even if we were in level 4 fort the election we would have mail in/drop in voting. Hell it would probably mean a higher percentage of citizens voted!

Disgustingly. Considering her party wanted looser restrictions.
Actually I don’t think there is a single person that wants the virus here.
"No the compromise is to do the lockdown, prioritise preventing the spread. Then hopefully offer additional support to minimise the negative effects on people’s mental health"
"I mean NZ has handled it about as well as you can without being Vietnam. Sitting here in the UK right now where it was never really brought under control, the half-arsed lockdown kept the health service from being overrun but that's about it. 45k+ dead, and record unemployment to go alongside it."
"The mental health of the people will decline alot more if COVID-19 was to spread. There are alot of people out there that will most likely die if they get this.

- old people. 

- cancer patients.

- pregnant woman.

- people that are on medication or got a condition that compromises their immune system (I'm part of this group).

And there are more, these are just the ones I can name off the top of my head. The best we can do is go hard and crush COVID-19 and then worry about mental health later (I know that my mental health would be better if a virus that can kill me isn't spreading like wildfire atleast). I'm not saying to ""forget about mental health"" because it is very important to keep an eye on, all I'm saying is that in order to help people's mental health we need to put it aside for a little while so we can make a less stressful environment and hopefully help people's mental health out in the long run, and ofcourse preventing people from getting really sick and dying is great too."
I'm like 80% serious when I say that another lockdown like the last would kill me.
"National who clamoured to end lockdown sooner, etc etc? Hope not"
nb4 the Crusher declares the Auckland case is a hoax and this is all an election ploy
"Depends which politicians shoot themselves in the foot, by word or action. And also how successful the response to this round is."
Nah. Jacinda's just got it locked. Most National  can hope to do is get enough votes to force her to take coalition partners. Which as a Greens supporter I'm fine with. Least concerned I've ever been about an election this one just quietly. (that doesn't mean don't fucking vote you vote ghosts)
"I dunno man, someone would have to be a right dickhead to vote for a new government during all this, and National hasn’t exactly been knocking it out of the park lately."
"Doubtful. Jacinda is so clear and concise and proactive. We heard about community transmission and we're acting immediately.

JC will sling mud but it'll look in bad taste."
The true disaster for this sub.
Honestly get better priorities in life.
I can’t even fathom your priority being about how the election will be impacted from this.
"I’d say you’re worrying too much, but the hardcore national crew I know is already pissed off at the labour government for this as if it’s somehow their fault"
What are the obvious weak links?
"it's not a perfect system, it's impossible."
Maybe if you keep posting kiwiblog theyll take notice of you eventually
it needs to be literally clinical or there's no point
"I totally agree. This is absolute bullshit. We are an island nation with limited people coming in. And this still happens. I supported lockdown, I am not anti government, this is simply unacceptable."
Careful with that talk...
I didn’t realize it was a contest
"Local school of 500 kids just had 10 teachers test positive a few days ago, I was just checking the news to see if they reopened yet. Total morons, more than likely got 100+ kids now infected last week."
The average family size is 3.14 people so 127% of Americans have the disease?

I don’t think you read the post.
The government compiled a list of which services are essential and which aren’t
"Basically anyone involved in food production and distribution, and the emergency services and healthcare/hospital workers. There are other exceptions but that's the general idea."
"""Essential services including healthcare, justice services and businesses providing necessities are able to open."" This is from the NZ Covid-19 website - the government has decided what are essential businesses are what are not, but in Alert Level 3, I believe non-essential businesses that can operate in a contactless way can remain open. Shame to hear about those businesses staying open in the US; but we were also fortunate enough to have a wage subsidy that helped out a number of businesses during our first lockdown"
"* People must work from home unless that is not possible.

* Businesses can open premises, but cannot physically interact with customers.

* Low-risk local recreation activities are allowed.

* Public venues are closed. This includes libraries, museums, cinemas, food courts, gyms, pools, playgrounds, markets.

* Healthcare services use virtual, non-contact consultations where possible.

* Schools between years 1 to 10 and Early Childhood Education centres can safely open but will have limited capacity. Children should learn at home if possible.

* Physical distancing of 2 metres outside home including on public transport, or 1 metre in controlled environments like schools and workplaces.


Workplaces can only open if:

* workers cannot work from home, and
* workplaces are operating safely, and
* customers are not allowed on premises, and
* businesses can trade without physical contact with customers
(e.g. through phone/online orders, delivery, pick-up and
drive-through)"
"I work in a online used bookstore, in a warehouse. Books are not essential. They really aren't. I can understand some of Amazon, since it ships toiletries and tools/etc but.. Where I work is just straight books."
"Basically what essential means: infrastructure, healthcare, food and supply chains for all of the above.

Unfortunately this also means something stupid like an IT retailer who sells every now and then to police or hospitals gets to keep their entire warehouse and retail stores open... NZ might be better than the USA but you know damn well fucking Capitalists try their best to manipulate Government into allowing them to keep running their businesses and putting staff and their families at risk for profit."
"To be fair, all of those industries are quite hygiene focused anyways so I wouldn't be surprised if they reduced staff and found a way to do it safely. The dairy industry went uninterrupted in NZ during lockdown"
"The thing about school for kids of essential workers is a bit stupid, too. Our worst outbreak area is 80% essential workers. That would have meant 80% of the kids at school. Yes, you need childcare, but it needs to be more carefully arranged than that."
Well the factories are making essential products so it seems like they could never shut down even if they wanted to.
Essential workers is a much smaller group in NZ because the import just about everything that you can't get from the ocean or livestock. They don't have major manufacturers & raw stock operations. Major manufacturing economies can't shut down like this especially if they are global suppliers. (None of this is an insult to NZ - they are fantastic people who happen to have an unusual advantage geographically & economically in a pandemic)
"Vaccine should solve that. as of now it seems COVID-19 doesn’t mutate fast enough to be resistant and the early trials show very promising results when it comes to the body producing antibodies against it. So if all keeps going the way it is, hopefully COVID-19 will go the way of Polio."
"I am probably misunderstanding but I think with the vaccine, what we're hoping for isn't for every person to be perfectly immune, but to 1. Slow it (the less people that get it, the less people can spread it) and 2. If we get it it's not as severe 

If anyone more knowledgeable can add that'd be great"
So you are saying some one got infected and infected someone else? Damm only we had know.
"Borders have been closed to everyone except citizens and permanent residents for almost half a year now. Good morning, glad you could join us!"
"Weren't NZ's borders *already* closed?

Plus, citizenship doesn't change how likely it is for someone to have Covid. You either close borders or you don't."
Lmao thats been the rule for like 6 months anyway
[deleted]
"We can't pretend 'residents' haven't made a huge commitment to the move here. If your whole life is here being locked out from where you have your home, your kids go to school, you've got your support network or just in general where all your stuff is would be cruel."
This has been in play since March
Covid isnt like the the last plague of egypt. It doesnt pass over citizens.... and we have 1 million of those overseas
2 levels.
Is that even a transmission mechanism? How long does it last on surfaces?
"Complacency is likely responsible, and the truth is that it’s incredibly hard to avoid. We knew this would happen at some point. Now it has happened. Let’s deal with it."
Is this more likely to be from the harbors or airports?
Your fucks are misplaced....
"No, it means there were undetected cases. 

It takes weeks to show symptoms and most people show few to no symptoms. It’s a hard bug to keep track of."
Wellllllll... theres no valid answers but im leaning towards it is. But that means governments have to admit to being wrong. All 4 hospitals in my town are treating this as different. So far the ones with the least infected staff are treating it as airborne
[removed]
Thats the point of the initial 3 day lockdown to determine the origin of the cases and act from whatever is learnt from that.
"No, that’s why Auckland is going into lockdown so they can figure it out."
Seriously? Did you listen to the briefing or read the post at all?
No one knows atm.
"It's a well thought out and complete plan on how to react, it is being implemented immediately and there is no major outcry from the citizens about how they shouldn't have to do it.  Definitely not the US right now."
This but unironically
"I mean, statistically speaking, it's fairly likely this came from the shitshow that is the US"
Somehow
That's good and all but I mean like there's the pandemic too
Extremely unlikely there is any sort of coverup because some healthcare worker would've leaked it to Gerry Brownlee and he would've blurted to the media immediately.
"I work were all chch samples are tested, weve had like 1 pos in 2 weeks, maybe your tinfoil hat is on too tight"
"I seriously, seriously doubt that. I know we're in a bit of shock but let's keep this in perspective.
The govt have always said there will be flare ups 'when not if'. They have also pushed the bed for testing, good hygiene and face masks. The best explanation is probably just that this is a flats up that has been revealed. Possibly its in Christchurch too, possibly elsewhere. That's why level 2.
She'll be right."
A coverup would be doomed to backfire and the govt knows that
">Less than a few days ago, there was the ""respiratory illness"" breakout in ChCh. 

You mean today?"
"Hey mate.

While the govt will always release information in a manner that causes the least harm to the public, in a situation like you are describing the country would be locked down.

They will have teams trying to figure out the spread. Areas of risk.

They squashed the first wave. Should be right."
"Nah. This government has already proven it puts saving lives above minimising information available to public to reduce panic.

If you have any information on the Chch respiratory outbreak beyond what was reported both this sub and the MoH would be interested."
"Old people got the flu? No, it must be a conspiracy."
"Could be possible to a small extent, but if they were having tons of deaths a day, people would know. It's not the kind of thing you can hide for long. I don't think they would lie about it, because it'll spread the fastest if they don't tell the community. It'd be bad to try and hide it. It's possible though."
There are other respiratory viruses than SARS-CoV-2. It was probably just a regular flu.
It is a shit time of year for respiratory problems. The pine trees are having sex and dumping massive amounts of pollen into the air. Pretty much everyone I now that gets asthma or hayfever has had a flare up in the last week or so.
"woot, can you give me a source for the chch outbreak? I live here and haven't heard anything..."
"EDIT: I'm NOT a conspiracy nutter or anything like that. I'm genuinely curious, because these events are so coincidental."
Seems unlikely it would have gone undiscovered for over 3 months if this was still from our first outbreak.This has likely come through our border at some point since reopening.
You are delusion if you think there has been a hundred days of unoticed community transmission for the past 100 days.
Covid does not linger. It is so contagious that if it was in the community before now we would of known it
"I agree with you that real global numbers are considerably higher than reported and potentially above 100 million. But if we went 102 days without transmission in NZ with our testing rate then we had to of had it quelled for a moment.

Right now, there are probably more than 4 people with it in actuality in Auckland. We'll know if these measures were taking now work in about 2 weeks (as 95% of people who ever present symptoms do so within 14 days of infection). If we have none in 2 weeks we're probably OK and we can have confidence on that 2 weeks after that and If we don't have it under control in 2 weeks were fucked. Full second lockdown or just suffer through like everyone else becomes our only choices."
"As a Canadian, fuck America. Stop sneaking over our border you infected dicks."
All incoming passengers are put into mandatory supervised quarantine in hotels.
Or is two weeks quarantine not long enough?
Everyone is immediately quarantined with guards outside. Only a few have escaped and were quickly found and prosecuted.
The nicest way to express that is to just say it in your mind
Why did they change people half way through?
"I mean this in the nicest way, but you're wrong, and you're a cunt."
Heh. We were watching blackadder when the announcement notification came through
Nah. Electoral commission have backup plans for all levels.
Not so far.  Jacinda said that it is still too soon to be contemplating that
"It was incredibly naïve to assume NZ would never get a case again, I hope we hit this incredibly aggressively and then build a wall around the whole country (with a roof)"
"Cool, do you feel smart as fuck??"
Congratulations
">blatant government incompetence

Please elaborate?"
"They’re carrying out tracing as we speak, so hopefully they find the source of the cases."
Are you seriously blaming an entire city for the fact that we happen to have the biggest international airport in the country?
"It's just what happens cause you lot think you are gonna  get the shits. It's all good people, we did it once and we didn't have to jump in the shower after doing the loo. No one starved or went without toilet paper so chill........"
They've been saying that for weeks.
"Given the time it was gone, it's fairly credible that it was actually gone. Numbers were very low to begin with."
God no. They're continuing to test anyone in positions which might give them a greater risk of contracting covid.
"No we’ve been doing tests all along, if you suspect you have it you get tested, we also have had testing stations pop up around the country to do mass testing if you wanted, surprised these were super popular and had queues to get tested, even though we had had no positive cases for 100 days, the tests are free here"
"Testing has been happening constantly in these last 100 days. Our health minister has said prior to now constantly that we **will** have another outbreak. It's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. The when is now."
"Tests are continuing, you can just go ask your GP for one if you’re feeling ill. 3 months with no cases popping up in a hospital or anywhere means that, given what we know about the rate of spread and the percentage of people who need to be hospitalized, and the fact that the country has been operating like normal, there is virtually no chance that the virus was still here. The more likely option is that someone in that group of 4 is either lying or that a case slipped through from the border into security or staff."
"Half a million tests in a country of five million so yes we're testing.

ETA: NZ Lab Testing https://imgur.com/a/78nsS5J"
Ur gonna sit there and tell me I’m not completely protected from a virus when I get all my food from people I don’t know??
I talked to one guy from there who legit thought they located every single case. Insanity.
I think that’s conspiracy theory. There was always a chance of it returning and they were preparing us for it.
"It's the point where people start to get lax again, they haven't wanted us to go straight back entirely to normal as we've known since day 1 of 0 cases that there could be a second occurence of community transmission."
Honestly I don’t think so but it is quite a big coincidence.
Oddly convenient timing...
Thank goodness Trump banned travel to NZ!
~~Go fuck yourself.~~ We have well over 150k cases you have absolutely no room to criticize.
"Not necessarily, flight crew and quarantine workers - one of them asymptomatic crossing paths with someone in just the 'right' way with someone vulnerable (Hygiene, immune system, a cut in the wrong place...?).  

Could be a cat that roams the neigbourhood carrying the virus externally but not infected."
"This would be my guess, it's in nature and no longer containable"
"I would say that 4 cases is pretty nice compared to 5 million. Only a difference of 4,999,996."
Oh yeah cause NZ is totally a place filled with an endless amount of COVID cases. The government and health officials will take care of it.
"On the other hand, I'm trapped here with the psychopaths in america and quite jealous that 3 cases in huge news."
"It is easy for NZ to be Covid free, it's a country run by a smart government and filled with people that listen to health officials. This swift action by the NZ will quickly slow down the spread of these new cases and they'll go back to being Covid free again."
"We haven't been covid free for a while, we have been sitting on around 20 cases for a while the difference is we isolate them and don't allow them to leave a designated hotel."
They’ve still done amazing. It also seems the lockdown will only be 3 days right?
yep or someone told a boo boo
Sadly there is zero chance crowds will be allowed even if the game goes ahead.
"Auckland is now like the Hotel California. You can go there, but you cannot leave under Level 2."
"Hopefully they'll nip this in the bud, we'll have to wait for more info but I think the game will still go on"
Look what sub you're in fuckstick.
"I can think of two main reasons. 1.  They have had no cases for over 100 days, which is pretty damn impressive, even though they are an island.  2.  This is the New Zealand subreddit."
"cause they’re smart. they do what should be done. it’s really pretty there. you’re on the new zealand subreddit also, that might help a bit."
They're attractive people
They had seemingly eradicated the virus nationally until this. They're an example of how to do shit right and worth paying attention to.
"They’re a westernized country that has the best result in fighting the virus, putting to rest any other theories regarding authoritarianism, racism, or eugenics."
"I don’t see how you can read this post and not see how awesome it is compared to how the US is responding. American here I wish we had something like a ‘level four quarantine plan’, NZ’s contact tracing strategies and planning make them seem badass, their government is basically Batman compared to our administration"
"I do. Few redditors have any actual lived experience of NZ combined with many of those of the most adoring coming from the US. As someone born in NZ, still working there but living in the US I can promise you that there’s misinformation aplenty on both sides. The US has had some of shittiest most immoral national and in some cases state leadership on this possible. On the other hand I live somewhere with very competent state and local leadership. I have daily real time contact with people from NZ and I can assure you that our experience of COVID has been more similar than it has been different in my specific case. You wouldn’t know it to hear many NZers talk about what’s happening here though - and ofcourse why would they know any different than what’s on the nightly news? Similarly most people in the US think NZ is some beautiful but highly cute LOTR utopia with absolutely no problems. They would be shocked to know the history of coloniality, the underbelly of racism and the crushing poverty that many of my people live daily."
"Well their PM is sexy and smart, they have lots of sheep, and the entire LOTR franchise was film there. So take your pick.

Also they're one of the very very few countries that successfully combated the coronavirus.

Some American probably coughed on a blanket and left it there."
"Well, as a Swede, I don't understand reddit's total over-hyping of events in Sweden from time-to-time either. I guess small countries sometimes have an over-sized impact."
"That’s how you avoid reaching 40,000."
1 case in South Korea caused a huge outbreak in Daegu. Literally thousands. It’s great to see governments respond this way and be transparent.
"Yes, and the countries that wait until they have 40,000 cases before taking drastic action, they wish they had done so when they had just 4."
Better than treating 40000 like 4.
"It could be 40,000.

Probably not but here in the US we decide it's impossible but there they decide they need to act."
Oh fuck off you pillick
It’s called competence.
"Ok, dumbfuck. 

There's no words for how stupid do you have to be to think this.

Don't breed."
Lucky bastards.
The results speak a lot louder than you whining does
"As a fellow Ohioan, I wish our governor had any kind of plan close to what NZ has fore dealing with COVID"
All tests have a margin for error. I think the PCR nasal swabs are the more accurate ones but if the swabs arent taken correctly then it becomes an issue.
Antigen tests are notoriously inaccurate.
Also from Ohio! Feel the same way...doubting a lot...
"Antibodies can be found for months, maybe years after the virus has gone away"
The average person eats 8 bats in their sleep each year. Or we do in NZ at least.
How? Shutting the border? It would literally have been the only way.
"They said from the beginning there would likely be a second wave, just like other countries have experienced. Maybe blame the fuck heads who decided that quaratine wasn't for them and had a joyride around the country."
"They'd been telling people to get tests, and warning people about the potential of this since community transmission ended. Even reminding people to not get complacent, contact trace, and think about wearing masks...

What more could have been done?"
I wouldn't call it ineffective. Definitely imperfect tho.
"There is zero chance that if this was a week old, it would have taken to today to leak"
You mean 180 degrees. A 360 would’ve put them in the exact same spot. Though I see how tin foil hats could cause discombobulation
"Just do a 360 and walk back the way you came.

Whoaaaa. Bro. That's like some  4th dimensional shit."
"> Why would govt suddenly turn their rhetoric by 360 degrees?

Ummmmm....?"
"Coverup for a week then announce at 9pm?  To what end?  How would that in any way be better than simply announcing the moment they knew?  


**There is no way in hell a coverup would not backfire**.  And they're smart enough to realise that.

&#x200B;

So why the foreshadowing then?  We'll let me offer some ideas:

&#x200B;

* they could see what's happening overseas, especially Victoria
* they could see that NZ's population was getting complacent
* knowing a thing or two about risk management, they knew they could never be 100% certain it wasn't lurking somewhere
* history is clear that pandemics have a habit of coming back again and again

&#x200B;

Also, they had said plenty of times before that elimination was an ongoing process and we should always be ready for a resurgence."
"Calm your tits and don’t be a conspiretard.

Sure, the “government” might have had a suspicion that some shit was going down, but until proper testing was completed their hands are tied."
"Jacinda found out about it at 4pm today as soon as the tests were done. Masks were recommended last week as a precaution because of international evidence that they were effective in reducing community transmission rates, and due to the second waves occuring overseas. Take your conspiracy theories elsewhere."
That 360deg comment makes me think you are a troll. Hard to be sure these days
"I missed the recent scaremongering, links?"
"Here’s a stuff article on it

https://i.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122416730/coronavirus-auckland-moves-to-level-3-rest-of-nz-to-level-2-as-four-covid19-cases-confirmed-in-community"
"[https://www.tvnz.co.nz/latest](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/latest)

Theres a link to the livestream on there."
There is community transmission now hence back to lvl 3
There is community transmission now.
"The virus can be carried by animals. Dogs have died from it, and it can survive in the system of most mammals. Coming into contact with an infected animal will cause it to jump back into humans."
"They were madly contact tracing, trying to identify a source"
"If she just tweeted 'COVID19 confirmed community transmission in Auckland, stay calm' at 4:01 it would have created chaos. Better to wait till they have everything set up and a plan."
You know theres more then one link in disaster response aye? They would have had to see what data was available and if any sentinel testing picked up tests outside Auckland
they were waiting for countdown to close
They probably had to decide what to do?
"If I was her, I would've spent those 5 hours to calm down"
"She was travelling at the time, plus they needed time to create a clear plan before announcing everything to the country."
I thought that too
[deleted]
NZ will never stand for the death toll that Sweden has taken so far.
">Sweden has one of the highest global death rates from coronavirus.

I don't know about you but I don't think this country could recover from being a world leader in corona virus deaths."
"5763 fatalities in Sweden though, so far. 22 here. I think we're on the right track. Vaccines won't be too far off."
"> Sweden has one of the highest global death rates from coronavirus.

You can't just sacrifice people on the off-chance a vaccine isn't coming."
Bullshit. This is a minor setback. We're still doing far better than most anyone except Taiwan.
Those 5700 dead swedes won't be having the last laugh
Fuck. Off.
"The issue with this strategy is that catching the coronavirus doesn’t just mean you either die or recover perfectly, I believe 70% of all cases have lasting symptoms/effects on the respiratory system, and that’s obviously without knowledge of what happens in the long term - herd immunity is a bad idea until vaccines have been ruled out imo"
"Yeah, I don't think we can afford another 5 weeks at level 4. We will go broke. I would just close high risk, little return areas of society like night & strip clubs, encourage social distancing, mask wearing & working from home. Basically try and slow the spread of a virus to a dribble while hanging out for a vaccine early next year."
"They're seeing herd immunity, I'm seeing unicorns and pixie dust."
"Found the American!

The virus can be addressed in two ways as if nobody is carrying it, it can't be caught.  

1. Isolate until nobody is a carrier, or
2. Vaccinate until nobody is a carrier.

Countries managing the pandemic responsibly understand that 1. needs to be maximized until 2. is an option."
"It could have. It was the mass transit of citizens returning once the announcement of having to pay for qurantine. We had 28 positives at one time 1 week ago, the increase numbers puts strain on the systems in place and mistakes happen, it got out."
"Wrong, it certainly can, we did it before and will do it again. Dumb ass."
"Yup. Massive waste of resources.
How long are you going to keep this level of effort going?   Is it worth it?  What are you going to do a year to six months from now when a vaccine isn't 100 percent, and CV mutates x more times?

Reality is those at risk need to be careful, social distancing, masks, to some extent.

But for fuck sake you can't act like this is Ebola or the Spanish flu."
"You think they sat on it for a week then waited to 9pm to announce?  Doesn't stack up.

More that Dr Bloomfield was right - it was basically inevitable in the long term."
Something something broken clock.
Imagine your first thought when hearing about community transmission being back being to try and dunk on a political party you don't like...
What does this have to do with Chinese people? Fuck off

Yea nah
Ask again later though
Asking Reddit is pointless and shouldn't affect your decision. Reddit is a hivemind and people are not rational here.
"“Traveling in and out of Auckland is prohibited”
“Hey, can I go to Auckland?”"
Well ya see it can be low symptoms or a-symptomatic. So you were never clear of it.
That's pretty much how the entire world writes dates
Americas way is backwards AF.
I mean technically we do.
[deleted]
"For 100 days.... That's over 3 months we had no cases... Only at the border. After 3 months of literally going back to normal, it would have popped up a lot sooner. We were at 0. Sports grounds were full.... Malls, cinemas, bars, etc allllll full. You're telling me that a all the people that caught it with those 100 days were all asymptomatic?"
We've had about half a million tests in a country of a little under five million. Pretty sneaky virus if it's that simple.
"You mean, like, capitalise on the resurgence of the pandemic? For political gain?
 
Tbf i honestly wouldn’t put it past Collins."
"I think its the opposite. Scared people want stability not change.

Especially when that change is Judith Collins who seems volatile."
Yea but yuck
"They will definitely use this. ""This is shambolic! Our governement did this!""."
Because that worked well for Simon
"Are you familiar with the phrase ""perfect is the enemy of good""?"
">i cant imagine ever being able to contain it.

This seems a little...hyperbolic.  It hasn't even been a year yet, and you speak as though we've all been living in social distance cave homes for 15+ years."
"It isn't completely containable. Not in our current globalized World. There is absolutely not possibility to fully contain something, because you can't fully isolate yourselves from the Rest of the World. We rely on each other to maintain our way of living. And it's pretty sad that it has to take a deadly threat to make ourselves aware of that, instead of working together from the beginning and beeing open to eachother."
"woah mr fubertaway on reddit told us so?? Damn. This is game changing, I can't believe they didn't listen to you! 

It was always known that it was very likely for us to get new cases."
spot the conservative kiwi poster.
Are you serious? NZ is doing better than the majority of other countries in the world. Would you rather be in Australia or US?
What a brainwashed imbecile lol NZ has done an amazing job
"It was an inevitability, as previously stated by the PM before these most recent cases. There's plenty of things to complain about with the Labour government but pull your fucking head in."
"Count your blessings - at least you guys had 100 days free. Everyone in fucking world didn't get that chance without fear of catching COVID-19.

It's a good approach and your man Bloomfield has been saying that it's gonna happen eventually. Just need to make sure the right plan is in place to stop this."
"Because if there was no lockdown, the economy would be fine?

Tell that to the UK, to the US, and basically  every other country. Irrespective of your COVID response, your economy was going to get hammered by this. It's a global economy...

If you feel like reading some actual analysis and learning, then [here's a source](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R46270.pdf). If you just want to bitch and moan then carry on."
"I don't know how common this is. But I was rather ill a few weeks back for two weeks in total.
Called healthline as a precautionary measure and they told me to not go for a test as ""there was no covid in New Zealand"". They even asked me to repeat this to them. 
I stayed at home for the duration of my symptoms as a precautionary measure.
Wonder how many tests fell through the gaps because of this messaging from healthline..."
">Enjoy the economy we tanked for literally no reason

It would have tanked much much harder if we hadn't locked down."
Fuck off. Moaning prick.
"So what do you suggest since you know it all? Lol. 

Got to love cunts on Reddit who gloat behind a keyboard and arent doing shit but bitch about everything."
The fuck?
Please read the room
Haha yeah 🤣 😆 😅 😂
"What? Over their ability to handle a crisis? You're a fucking idiot. Go kill some kids and grandparents with community spread you inbred twat. Go spam your state's sub, they don't want us here."
Dude you’re a fucking dumbass bro
How do they act cocky? Oh your feelings are hurt because you can't get in?
Better than the US though
No bragging from this Kiwi. The majority of us were under no illusion that there was going to be a second wave. Hopefully we can deal with it better than Australia (Victoria) is right now.
"We just wanted a round 2, got bored while the rest of the world was still struggling.

Watch us beat it again"
We found Judith guys!
Take note how they're not fucking around now though. Watch for results.
But their response to 4 cases shows how pathetic the US response is.
"I remember a certain president saying that ""its only one case, it will be down to zero soon"" and then took no action, how did that turn out? Everyone I know supports the lockdown here because we have seen elsewhere what can happen if you allow this virus to spread unchecked."
I would have happily locked down for a few weeks for 4 cases instead of being afraid of leaving my house for 4 months...
"This is why new Zealand is doing well it is far from crazy, America is crazy"
The entire pandemic began with a single case. Shutting down just one city because of four is the appropriate response.
There’s a reason they got to zero cases for so long. They won’t have another explosion either I’m willing to bet.
Better do this when you have 4 confirmed cases than when you have 400 confirmed cases.
"Tested/confirmed cases don't equal actual cases.  Where there are 4 confirmed, there could be 400 in the community."
It's because its only 4 cases that this can work. They're immediately stamping out any possible chance of the virus transmitting between people. It's why they are one of the few country who ~~have~~ had 0 cases.
They REALLY don't want it to spread
"Crazy to actually address the problem head on. 🤦‍♂️ When people’s lives and livelihoods are on this line, a little over reaction is more than justified. Their economy isn’t wrecked, their death toll and new transmissions are low/none and they’ve reacted like this since close to the beginning of the pandemic. Where’s the problem exactly?"
these drastic measures now save a while lot of trouble in the future. there’s only 4 cases IDENTIFIED. who knows how many have still got it but have yet to be tested positive. at this stage it seems the virus is more resilient than first thought. that attitude of “oh it won’t happen to me” or “its only a few cases dont worry” is what can really compromise diligent efforts.
Each of those people probably were in contact with many others in the days before they realized they had covid. So the idea is partly to stamp out any other potential spread in the unknown number of new cases.
Give your balls a tug
I think it’s because they have an opportunity to extinguish it. If there were hundreds or thousands of cases it’s like stopping the wind at that point
"It's like dieting. You control yourself and discipline yourself for a few months or a year or two. In return you don't die at 35 of a year attack and add 50 years to your life.

Short term pain. Long term gain.

All good things require sacrifice."
That’s what it looks like when you have a competent leader.
Probably taking it this seriously with few cases are why the remain so low.
"4 cases turn into 40 cases turns into 400 cases very fuckin quick. Melbourne caught their outbreak at around 30 new cases/day. Within 2 weeks, it had all gone sideways with triple digits daily."
Actual brainlet
"You heard it here first. Elect Democrats, don’t have 160 k+ dead."
"How many cases do they have vs how many the USA has again? 

Looks like as far as cases per capita goes, New Zealand is 159th and USA is... 9th. 9th worst in the entire world and climbing."
Yeah th American conservative government is kicking ass isnt it
"If you elect them they are democratic by definition. 

If you're going to take a shot at Democrats at least do it right. 

Republicans were more fun in the 80s."
"Yes all elections follow a democratic model. 
Elections = democracy.

Wanna try again with your sentence? Before you do, please keep in mind that NZ does not have a democrat party. And US dems are nothing like other nation's Labour parties and are instead more aligned with the further right Lib parties, in many aspects. 

Maybe read a book about the basic principles of democracy and political parties ideologies?"
Piss Off.
Nah it’s more like thee area that got it doesn’t put health and getting tested a priority. The alarming thing that set Ards off is that the case was found in a poor socioeconomic area and the community are high risk who can’t afford health. Shit can turn really bad really quickly with that combination.
"Herd immunity doesn't work, btw. There are people getting it for a 2nd or 3rd time.  Also the immunity fades after 3 months."
"It's true that the gyrations suck economically, but being stuck half-shut for half a year (like what's happening in the UK and US) is worse, I reckon. With the gyrations you at least have clear-cut start and end points for each segment and you can operate normally the rest of the time.

I'm not an economist of course."
Yeah coz that is working well in the US.
"We would be much better off if we accept that tens of housands of people will die, and hundreds of thousands will have permanent damage and life-long health problems. 

Either that, or you're an idiot."
There is no herd immunity as yet confirmed. People are catching it 2 and 3 times. It's not a reliable path to take at all.
I mean we're literally living through a global pandemic which will result in millions of people dying (should nothing change from the current rate) so I think the global and therefore the local economy will be heavily impacted either way. The best thing we can try to do is come through with everyone alive.
Fuck. Off.
Not sure why you're being downvoted. This is not a sustainable long term solution.
"I want the country to go to level 2 though, would rather people didn't die ay"
Just let it spread?
Because they can’t count to Two?
Bro straight facts
Go home Karen
There’s a reason they had no cases for 100 days.
"Yeah you shut shit down for a couple of weeks and they may get another 100+ days of zero cases. 

I’d wish like fucking hell that the US would shut down instead of getting 50k+ new cases a day"
"They just spend over 100 days completely covid free, with zero lockdown, because they took this level of precaution early on.

They've eradicated it once, they'll just do it again. And at the end of the day, they'll get to resume normal life before anyone in the US will."
Imagine caring for your (and other people’s) health.
Please don’t be American.. please don’t be American!
Sorry but I think you're actually dumb
"You're actually stupid

Probably American right?

Edit: your comment history isn't pretty"
"And people like you are the problem,and why we'rethe laughing stock of the world. You're an ill informed, selfish cunt, and because of you and people like you were going to be in this mess for years and a lot of people are going to die. 

As an American, people like this fuck bring such shame upon us. Fucking uneducated ""but muh rights! Fuck you, I got mine"" pieces of shit. America needs to split into two and let these people have their own shithole country and stop having states hold back other states. 

I'm so fucking sick of this shit, and the scumbag, idiotic, fucking garbage pile Trump is just beating the fuck out of America. 

As an American, sorry rest of the rational, science-minded world."
"We definitely stamped it out; if there had been even one case remaining, just think how much it would have spread in 3 months. In that time, at least one of the people it infected would've gotten sick enough to get tested or end up in hospital."
That's not how it works
Wow what an actual piece of shit. So people should die now because they had a manageable response to a deadly virus? Fuck you
That's a terrible thing to say.  They have handled and are handling the virus much better than a lot of countries and that's why there are such low cases that are caught early and quickly.
Idk how to tell you this but you're supposed to care about other people
Your inability to spell big words correctly is insufferable.
What the fuck dude
"What is wrong with you? 

I suggest getting help."

"Survive =/= Recover 

At this point it's probably too late for someone to actually educate themselves willingly, but I'll still try.

""out of 416 hospitalized Covid-19 patients, 19% showed signs of heart damage.""

""Now, physicians warn that Covid-19 survivors may experience long-lasting cardiac damage and cardiovascular problems, which could increase their risk for heart attack and stroke."" (For life)

""Physicians have also found evidence of scarring in Covid-19 patients' lungs. According to Parshley, some CT scans show Covid-19 patients have light gray patches on their lungs called ""ground-glass opacities,"" which don't always heal. One Chinese study found the patches in 77% of patients""

""Mitchell Elkind, president-elect of the American Heart Association and professor of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University, said doctors should be ""on the lookout for LONG-TERM neurocognitive problems,"" including decreased concentration and memory as well as dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that lead to the ""arms, legs, fingers, and toes."""
It is so odd seeing proof that people like you actually exist.
I can't imagine living in a country that managed this so poorly that they effectively kill around 160k of their citizens. Yet here we are and there you are champ
"President Trump thought something similar back in the lost month of February, now we have a shuttering economy and 165k+ dead who might’ve been alive today. What is 4 cases now will turn into widespread contagion, multiple deaths, and severe economic downturn. The ability to have some level of foresight is a valuable tool in life, and thankfully some leaders in the world still seem to have that even though the leader of the “free world” doesn’t."
I can't imagine living in a place which lets over a 1000 of it citizens die every day from a communicable disease and does f*ck all to stop it.
"and until you or your relatives catch it, you're going to continue to think it's a harmless virus."
"Only 90% of people recover from it but thanks for playing. What are we up too 165,000 dead now? Mostly because assholes like you drank the maga cool aid."
fuck those .2% for trying to live
"Then you can’t imagine a proper response to the virus.

NZ is doing the best *in the whole world* right now at managing the virus, and has been for awhile. We could learn a thing or two from this. These restrictions are temporary, but have saved hundreds if not thousands of lives. If you are unwilling to put up with a temporary inconvenience that is exceptionally effective at saving lives, then YOU are the problem."
Almost like they actually care about their population.
"Instead you live in a place where the government said ""fuck it! People can go fuck themselves and we'll give billions to corporations for funsies!"" Yeah you're right, your way is so much better"
"The WHO has the mortality rate sitting at just above 3%. And while most won't die from it, it's looking like there might be some pretty serious long term effects in a number of those who do survive, including people with young age and no previous conditions. A population with lung, heart, kidney and brain aflictions becomes a pretty serious publi health problem."
[deleted]
And they’re basically living life as normal for the past 3 months.
Did you miss the part where they haven’t had new Covid cases before this as a direct result of their heavy-handedness for over 100 days?
About 1 in 2000 americans have died from Covid
That number starts to go way down when the hospitals are overfilled.
That's not what they're doing...
"Yeah, I wish other countries were as well prepared as they were."
Don't know where you got those stats. It's more like 96.8% of people survive (for the U.S. specifically). That's about one in thirty people die. Do you know thirty people? And even the ones who survive can get permanent heart and lung damage.
Finally someone with valid points.
"So let me get this straight, instead of $585.80 per week, that we already got for 12 weeks, totalling over $7000, you'd rather have had a one off payment of US$1200 or NZ$1815?

You might want to redo the math on that one.

And btw, many people didn't qualify, and even if they did, many of them haven't even received their $1200 yet, months later."
Why the fuck would we want to look at what the USA is doing ?
"We got nothing? Have you been in a coma, or did you miss the whole 12 week subsidy thing?"
Hahaha money printer go brrrrr
">we got nothing here in NZ..

Lots of americans got nothing either because the Treasury fucked it up"
Yes lets be more like America..
We got it once and we have to listen to orange cheeto man talk out his ass every day while our cases fly off the charts. I would trade my one time measly 1200 which didn't even cover rent for a month in exchange to not live in this garbage country.
"Oh, not everyone in US. Only those below certain income limits and filed taxes."
Ya know Zimbabwe might have had the right idea... Hold my hyperinflation.
"1% is quite a lot of people. More also have lasting lung damage when moderately to severely affected.

Not to mention we still have low numbers of ventilators.

Nah, you can fuck off."
"Will you still be such a smug fuck if -- assuming you're capable of it -- someone you care about falls into that one percent? 

Or if *you* catch it, survive through what is generally regarded as a complete horror show and then get to watch excitedly as scientists keep revealing the long term effects?"
"Either you're stupid or willfully ignorant, and I'm not sure which is worse."
You do realize how high 99% is right. You'll basically know of someone who died. Or put another way 1 out of 40 houses on average will have someone who dies.
Eat a dick. It's not about you surviving it's about you doing your bit to ensure other people do.
"Only potentially 50,000 dead Kiwis dieing alone in isolation retching up their lungs"
Deadset moron
"97% in NZ. If everyone got it >140,000 people would die."
That is fucking bad!!!!
They've handled the virus infinitively better than the US
Let's play spot the American. Found one!
"Reporting facts, bragging...same thing, right?"
They haven't had a confirmed case in over 100 days and now they have only 4. They'll re-beat it pretty soon. They have every right to brag.
Here in America we just brag about it everyday and ignore that it actually exists. Great times in 2020
Nothing wrong celebrating when they see their efforts pay off.
"We've done it once, we can do it again, and we'll be laughing twice as hard when we do.

Stay mad."
"Haven't got been paying attention? The way to not get more cases is to not test.

That way they can confine bragging, and not have to do the pesky work of actually dealing with it."
"NZ didn't celebrate too early. We were covid free, it's unknown where these cases came from and they've shown up very bizarrely. There was no early celebration. The government even had a plan designed and in place for a second wave if it happened, which it has. The entire country and the government worked super hard to deal with it and they did, don't shit on those efforts."
"If that was the case we'd have seen cases hit the hospitals.

We have positive cases at the border every other day. No need to invent bullshit to explain this."
"We celebrated 100 days it is now 102, so no not too early"
"I agree that no one should celebrate too soon. But what you've said is not quite right. It's always been accepted that another wave will come. The past several weeks has had a heap of top down info saying it's a case of when, not if, and we've heard it. 
What was being celebrated was getting community transmission down to zero percent, and being able to reopen the economy. And achieving that for a streak of over a hundred days is worth celebrating.
If there was a presence of community transmission during that time, it would have been extremely apparent."
Being poor is a small price to pay for not being Australian.

Just because coronavirus might stay doesn’t mean we shouldn’t still be safe and protect the vulnerable
"The flu comes every year and preventative measures are still taken.  Coronavirus is a single chain RNA virus that does not use genetic recombination, unlike the flu, meaning a vaccine should be highly effective in providing immunity."
Found the fucktard
"Dude, have you seen what the death and cases data would look like if we didn't wear masks and treated this shit like a common cold? 

What should give new meaning to our lives is the fact that 160,000+ people have died. It's not some selfish way to add meaning to our lives. It's to protect everyone. Please, just go talk to a scientist and at least try to understand some of the ideas behind why we need to do the things that New Zealand is doing."
Can we start wearing masks to prevent the spread of the common cold too? I'm down for that. Looks better than following my coworkers around with the lysol.
Oh good you again who wants the whole country infected like it's a big pox party.

It wasn’t for nothing they’ve had 22 deaths while the US is now 163k dead...
How is saving lives *nothing*?
Bro do you think US economy is booming? You just got both end of the stick. The layoff and the widespread infections and deaths. Now you won’t be able to afford healthcare because jobless. Oups no social security 🤭

Fascism is the in thing and so is complacency to said fascism.
An inevitablity has occurred and *that's* your takeaway from this?
How the fuck dumb do you have to be to jump to this conclusion?
Says Who? You and your uneducated views
So they deserve to die for (rightfully) being proud of their country?
"Lmao they went 100 days without lockdown and no spread, they should be proud. You’re pathetic"
Or someone who came from overseas snuck out of their quarantine while they had the virus and passed it onto someone rather than it being around without them knowing for the last 100 days
"In the long run, we've seen that shutting down strong and early actually protects economies.  Yes, there is that initial financial hit from shutting down, but over time that damage is much smaller than the damage done to economies who don't shut down strong enough and then end up with longer lock downs overall as hospital systems struggle and consumer confidence hits rock bottom.  It's better to do it quick and get the cases down, than it is to keep the economy open in a way where cases grow and end up doing way more finamcial harm long term."
"Is this sarcasm ? 

They've been literally living life normally for 3 months while most Americans are overstressed and not attending their loved ones funerals. 

A quarantine like this to prevent the death of even one citizen SHOULD be worth the price it costs. And in 2-3 weeks, there's a chance they can go back to normal. In the US, we won't be back to normalcy until atleast mid 2021. And that's if a vaccine is made in time."
Seems to be fine since they got low unemployment and low to zero death.  What are you proud of?
Captain retard over here
Close now while you have at least 4 cases OR close in a month when you have at least 5000 cases and hospitals are full.
Propose a better plan?
"First they will have people left to rebuild the economy.

Secondly, they have had a total removal of lockdown nationally prior to this, this is for 3 days, while they track and trace and find who actually needs to be quarantined. Then they can think about lifting restrictions, 3 days. 

Whereas in the US a national lockdown of weeks, maybe months would be required to even get to a point where you could consider 3 day city/state wide lockdowns to get it under control."
The problem is that a few cases can very easily grow into many cases. If NZ doesn't have any Covid cases anymore they can again mostly lift restrictions.
The infectivity of sars-cov-2 is off the charts. This barstard thing is very hard to stop without serious measures. New Zealand's Adern government gets it.
Good luck with your pandemic
Their cities are going to be shut down for only 2 weeks while the cities in the US are spreading the virus and building it up for another major economic collapse.
Economy? Just print money. Everyone is doing it.
If they lock down and identfy those contacted they can control it and reopen in a matter of days. Well worth as it minimises the economic effects along with minimising deaths.
Spotted the american lmao
"So the man hasn’t travelled overseas so they assume he got it from someone else in the country therefore there is an uncontained outbreak at the moment. 

This is different than a guy coming back from the United States and testing positive."
"On the flip side, the damage to the economy of doing nothing is catastrophic. The US could have avoided so much economic disaster by acting more decisively."
"When cases appear out of nowhere you mean.  


This isn't an overseas traveller. These are cases with no line of transmission.  


That indicates possible ongoing community spread that has been unidentified.  


Victoria, Australia is the case example of what not to do. They went slowly and methodically and will take months to go back to normal. If they had have locked everything down immediately it would never have gotten out of control.  


NZ doing everything correctly."
It is what it is

"Lock down 3 weeks, complete freedom for a while, no long lasting health conditions for general population. Enjoy healthy country. Other countries spending billions on medical and always paranoid"
"In my opinion, countries like America should definitely not take credit for trying to achieve ‘heard immunity’. Countries need to actively avoid thousands of covid deaths and they attempt to control the virus even if it seems hard to do so."
"Herd immunity requires a lot of death and physical and mental destruction, not to mention the economical impact. HI is not the solution here."
..found crushers reddit account
Herd Immunity doesn't work for this - there's too many strains and no evidence of immunity after infection and survival.
"Begone, fucktard"
Except people are losing the antibodies once getting infected and can get reinfected. So herd immunity isn't the answer.
"I am not judging which approach is better or not, I am pointing out that this approach also has it's disadvantages, especially if the herd immunity threshold is much less than the earlier predictions of 80%.  Given NZ's location in the world and being much easier to completely isolate, for them their approach is probably the best.  You can't take their approach and assume it's practical for every country in the world, especially the US.

From a study on Sweden;

""That pattern indicates that the HIT had been reached by 11April, at which point only 17% of the population appear to have been infected.""

Fuck off dude. This was always going to happen. The fact we got this far is testament to our hard mahi and their leadership.

""""
That’s the date.
"That’s how many countries format the date; day, month, year."
Because the rest of the world knows how to write the date.
Many (perhaps even most) countries put the day then month
11th day of August (08)
It's the date.. 11th of August
Because many places don't use the Month/Day/Year convention. They use Day/Month/Year.
"It's October already, didn't you know?"
"Because it's the 11th day of the 8th month in New Zealand. This is more commonly used in military in the UK and US. But most other dates are mm/dd/yyyy. Where as in most other countries in the world they use dd/mm/yy. 

Either this is more common in New Zealand, or this person likes military standards.

Edit: Turns out the mm/dd/yyyy format is entirely american and I misunderstood. Apparently UK only uses it to accommodate the US. So chill. 
Removed some incorrect information."
Huh? We only went to Level 4 because we had community spread.
22 deaths is better than 163k deaths that could’ve been prevented in the US. They get to be cocky. They’re doing better than a lot of places and that’s a fact.

That's not true at all about the 5 million sick in the U.S.. If you really think that a few cases is equal to an institutional failure of medical care and pandemic control, then I pity your critical thinking abilities."
America had more cases in the time it took you to write this post than New Zealand has had in 100 days. Not sure how that proves America’s response has been anything but criminal but it does help us see the logic behind the problem in America.
"Nz has 4 cases so I locking down its biggest city. US has 10s of thousands of new cases daily and thousands of deaths is in partial lockdown in some places.

We have 1000 dying daily and they have 4 active cases now. I’m just not sure it’s really closing the gap...
"How is that argument over? There are taking the necessary steps to contain it when found, and will be back to zero soon."
"How does this make any sense? We have a thousand deaths per day, they have 4 cases after 100 days of no cases. If anything how they’re handling this makes me like NZ even more because we could never get our shit together like that. The new cases would just been seen as more sacrifices to our billionaire overlords."
"Your kidding right? This whole post just shows how seriously New Zealand responds to it compared to America. If it were the USA half of those people wouldn't have bothered to get tested.

*Ipad Edit because I can't on the damn thing."
Except the argument still stands. Look at NZ response to the US's
You have the logic of a single celled amoeba.
"You realize all of this is over three cases, whereas America gains millions every day? Your statement is simply moronic"
"Are you seriously comparing a few isolated cases in a country that managed and effectively beat the pandemic to the thousand+ new cases every day in America?

You are a fucking moron."
You’re comparing NZ’s 4 new cases after 100 days of no new cases to USA’s 40 THOUSAND cases on August 10... and saying that now NZ is as bad as USA? Lol
[deleted]
Me too but to be fair we aren’t handling the virus well. The rest of the world looks at us the way we look at Florida.
I know. Their whole four cases really makes a mockery of the idea that they’ve handled it well.
Because of 4 cases after 100+ days of relatively 0 transmission?? Okay.
Do you wake up in the morning with the intent to say some stupid shit or is it on accident
"The argument isnt even close to over, jackass. The US is an absolute disaster."
Except they are actually taking the virus seriously. They are setting up roadblocks for 4 confirmed cases. Here in the US there are tens of thousands of cases and everyone is just chillin on the beach. That is why NZ has had so few cases. They actually care about the well-being of their citizens.
Yeah but they actually have a nationwide plan.
"4 cases a day vs 60,000 cases a day. 

You forgot to pay attention in math classes?"
So new Zealand is bad now because they take getting 4 cases more seriously than America takes getting 4 million cases?
"Are you kidding? US has 160,000 DEAD. Gone! For no reason at all. No reason! Incompetent hateful Trump voters. That's the reason. Literally killing their friends and family with their selfish stupidity."
That argument is never over
I mean New Zealand is still objectively better than USA right now. Also it’s 4 cases it’s not like it’s a massive surge
So triggered
"The only people saying that are other Americans, worry about your own country and we will worry about ours."
So sick of stupid redditors that try to make other countries look bad when they clearly make logical decisions to stop the spread of Covid 19.
America sucks.
Yeah well screw you. We deserve this. We are actual cockroaches at this point.
Are you retarded?
"I would like to know, as an American, how this incident changes anything?

In America, we are currently doing little to nothing as the virus ravages the entire country. Thousands are dying every day as we open the schools with a literal plan that is ""Schools need to open."" and nothing more than that.

All that this does in remind every American how shit the US government is. 4 cases and they immediately jumped into action, creating a bubble, doing contact tracing, and widespread testing. Meanwhile, I personally know two people who are more than a week and a half into a wait for their test results.

The argument is stronger more than ever."
Idk what people like you don't understand about exponential growth

American fool.
"Ok buddy. Just cause your shit is fucked, doesn't mean ours has to be. Maybe we like our communities covid-free"
That's why NZ is the complete opposite of the US in terms of infections and deaths. They react quickly and effectively based on science. It's not an overreaction.
"You're pretty fucking dumb, huh buddy?"

Love being alive to wipe my bum.
Did you read the article?
The report says no.
No links at all to the isolation centres. So sounds to me that they just haven't been testing enough to find cases. Statistically possible. Singapore tests over 20k per day with a similar population to NZ.

"I don’t know how you can say “America wins in the end” when 160,000+ Americans have died and theres no promising sign of it slowing anytime soon. 

this isn’t a game you inbred dick hole. there’s no winning. people are dying and you’re proud of the economy opening back up??? even when unemployment is still at 10% uh lol ok......your username is spot on, you are very daft, so I guess you got one thing right.

edit: just wanted to add that NZ’s unemployment rate is 4.2% ....that’s what ours was BEFORE we shut down. maybe shut the fuck up?"
"You're the reason we can't have nice things, you star spangled ass flap."
"I don't think you're in any position to talk about this the way you do. 

The US still have over 2 Million active cases with obviously sick people going out and (re)infecting others, endangering lives. Meanwhile you are shaming NZ for having almost beaten the cv crisis. Why this ""us vs everyone"" mentality, it has only brought us wars and death between what should be equal people. 

Some americans always want to watch OUR world burn and are even proud of winning. HOW CAN YOU WIN A FRICKING PANDEMIC? Is everything just a game for you??

"Mate, stick a sock in it. We never bragged we didn't have cases, we were proud of our low case numbers and death rate, and I'd say deservedly so. Also the mindset that a virus with debilitating or fatal consequences is a fair punishment for being proud in one's country's achievements is frankly pretty appalling."

I mean they didn't. And look how easy it is to control it again with a competent government.
Who are you talking to?
"Hey listen here dick pills

Here in NZ we totally expected a resurgence, we knew at some point this unfortunate situation could happen,  majority of the press has been from international sources.

Here in Nz we have a thing called tall poppy syndrome.. look it up.

 and you bet youre ass anyone crying their freedoms are affected or some A-hole boss forces employees to work unsafely, the majority will whap them into place

We never bragged or expected this was the status quo forever,

 we were just happy for at least 100 days or so, shit was normal"
"Yup, I told people that it will re-emerge. It’s a virus not a army. 

You can be careful, but without constant border checks (and guards that don’t accept bribes) its impossible to be 100% infection free for long periods of time. Maybe a few weeks or so but not long. 

Got downvoted lmao from it."
"Eliminate. We can't eliminate the virus until there's an effective vaccine that's widely adopted.

We most certainly CAN control its spread. To suggest otherwise is to deny the evidence that New Zealand placed in front of our eyes."

What do you mean by this?
Hey look an American
The fuck you are talking? As a biologist myself I can tell you this is pretty much false.
"Why don't you approach a recognized health institution or medical journal about these huge discoveries of yours? You'd change the world, be seen as a hero  ...assuming you can prove the claims scientifically of course."
Coronaviruses do not mutate especially fast.
That's is patently false
You should do us all a favor and destroy your ability to go online and spread BS like this.
"""If I drop terms like Bayesian Statistics it'll cover up for me not having the slightest fucking clue what I'm talking about"" lolol"
"You're wrong. If a cluster of people was tested positive, there is no need to correct w/ bayasian statistics. They have probably been tested multiple times, which means the bayasian effect is mich less. The PCR tests can detect from 40 copy nr per ml, and are highly highly sensitive. Please do not spread misinformation regarding testing.
Corona viruses are also very stable in their genetic make up and do not mutate easily, unlike e.g. Influenza viruses, which have a completely different genetics, despite also being RNA viruses."
"(1) is pretty misleading. It's true that the posterior probability of having coronavirus is around 50% (last I heard) for a single asymptomatic individual with a positive test result. But the posterior probability is dramatically higher when you have a joint prior over seven people in the same household, two of whom have symptoms, and observe four positive tests. (Keep in mind that these are very much not independent!)

Also, posterior probability isn't the right metric to inform public health responses in this sort of situation. The odds ratio is generally a better measure; I don't know the efficacy of the most recent available tests, but last I checked the odds ratio associated with a positive test was on the order of 100, which is quite high."
you’re so full of shit
What does bayesian have to do with false positives or true positives? That is as much a frequentist concept as it is bayesian.
"As someone from New Zealand, I think it is important trace, follow and stop transmission as early as possible. We went 100 days without transmission after a brutal 4 week lockdown, and life is basically normal for us. Why shouldn't we try stop this so we don't have to go through the casualties of not caring about it or the economic loss of full lockdown for anothe month?"
lol your country isn't doing too well and you say we're paranoid?
Better few days of quarantine now than few weeks of quarantine later
"We're an island - we can do things differently.

If we can lock down briefly so that we can go back to 99% normal afterwards, then why wouldn't we?"
"Very irresponsible of you to say anything about being paranoid when it comes to general safety.


This is no joke and Sweden didn't exactly show a great strategy for fighting the virus.

To use some of your language, I think Sweden is not paranoid enough."
Our strategy is to flatten the curve so that our hospitals won’t get overwhelmed at any given time
Yep

Dude. It's definitely come from a covid positive returning new Zealander
There’s no way it survived 3 months without someone noticing symptoms and being tested
.... thats your conclusion? don't ready much international news eh
?? It almost certainly has not been in the community the entire time or we would have seen the wide spread effects months ago. It''s likely a new breach.
You're not only wrong. You're stupid.
Lol
The lockdowns weren't a 'waste' - they significantly helped NZ be able to eliminate community transmission for so long
The scammer is your own govt not ours
Whats the scam here?
Because generally we're not fucking muppets.
"Apart from the other responses you've already received: it's not four cases. It's four cases *that they know about* plus an unknown number of cases that they *don't* know about yet--after all, these people had to have picked it up from *somewhere*, and they've already been infectious for an unknown period of time.

A quick response like this ensures that the virus doesn't continue spreading unchecked while the authorities find and quarantine all those other unknown cases, which reduces the chance of a full-on outbreak significantly.

This kind of response is why New Zealand's been able to have sports and large gatherings while the rest of the world looks on in envy."
"Because a lockdown does less damage to the economy and is cheaper to recover from than letting the virus run rampant and having people take health precautions into their own hands for months / years, such as avoiding going out and spending money in the local community."
".5% of NZ is ~24k people

They are not ok with killing that many people."
Remember when the US had 7 cases?
"We have patience and a love for the lives around us. I may be safe, but more than that I'd like to ensure the safety of those around me."
Because you don't respond to a pandemic AFTER your hospitals are over run.
We’ll take our ‘crazy’ over America’s ‘stupid’ any day thanks.
Because we don’t to become something like America
"Because by undergoing less than a week of harsh restrictions, they hope to squash the community transmission and be able to fully reopen soon thereafter, similar to what they were previously able to do.  

New Zealand has had incredible economic benefits from being COVID free, and a bit of short term sacrifice is worthwhile to avoid a protracted semi-closure of the kind seen in other countries."
"You’re an idiot. This is the exact reason why they haven’t had community transmission in 100 days and are allowed to live freely, going to sports games and large gatherings... are you really that dense? They are doing the right thing, so they have 4 cases... but America has 5 million..."
"Because they work? 

They aren't ""harsh restrictions"" they are guidelines set by professionals and experts that the majority of us are happy to follow as we know it is for the greater good.

We had months of normality because of our chosen method, and it will return very soon.

Id rather this than the chaos and death other countries are experiencing."
"Mate, if it saves one life it's worth it. If New Zealand hadn't taken such strict measures there would be thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths in the country by now. There's nothing crazy about it."
cause we're not fucken stupid and value lives over profit.
"Because they dont wanna have that second wave hitting em hard ? Its pretty logical. Its for your and that of your family’s health. 
Edit: i also did some quick maths, there are about 20.1 million cases and about 747.000 deaths, this brings us at a death rate of 3.71 % and thats only deaths and infected people we know about. More americans died of covid than in WW2. So dont say they are crazy. You are."
Empathy and compassion.
Terrorists kill less and I have to take my shoes off everyday. This is what leadership looks like.
Maybe because they don’t want it to spread again after succeding to supress it ?
"99.5 is not a correct figure but even if it was that would still mean 2,500 avoidable deaths you halfwit. Go back to figuring out how the earth is flat."
"Because they arent morons.
It's called a pandemic not a reason to take freedoms away.

Grow up you small minded child.

Edit: Nevermind you belong to lockdown skeptics. Idiot confirmed and approved."
"4 turns into 8, 8 turns into 16, so forth"

"NZ is also going a lot harder with the restrictions. The only thing QLD did was to close the borders, and heavily encourage testing/staying at home.

Thankfully QLDers actually came through and got tested like crazy (3-4x the rate of the week before). if NZers do the same I have faith you guys will pull through quick and easy.

2 weeks of restrictions straight away is a lot better than enjoying freedom for a few weeks more then having to lockdown for 6+ weeks (poor Victoria)."

"A strong starter is the key. There’s all kinds of other techniques from mixing to shaping to proofing but you ain’t going nowhere with a sad starter. For best results:
- Feed twice daily at 1:2:2 starter:flour: water
- use only distilled water

-organic flour ideal as no bleaching or addition of yeast killing chemicals
-flour mix I usually rock is 80:20 white: rye but 50:50 white: whole wheat also good. Play around. 
- Rye and whole-wheat have high sugar sources so promote more vigorous fermentation from the yeast, however have weaker gluten strands so break down from to much acidity caused by yeast development. Cutting with white solves this.
- try to always feed starter at its peak rise. This will strengthen it. Feeding at the base of the collapse will weaken. 
- store in a consistent warm area - hot water cupboard great. 
- when your rises are consistent in timing and minimum 200%, ideal 300%+ in volume... she’s ready to go for epic sourdough bread.

Film is picking up. Seems to be the best course of action to stay industry related. But who knows what will happen.
Three days changes a lot in this industry. Clients won't want to put on events now because they can't risk causing an outbreak. The general public will be very cautious of going to gigs. Months and months of work that had just come back will now be in jeopardy.
Would it be best to contact it now (is it 24 hours?) or wait till morning?
"I'm kinda kicking myself because from what I've heard it sounds like covid from them but my whole family was saying nah don't worry its just the flu. With this mass alert im done im going to do this I don't care if family get mad at me for ""dobbing them in"" or some BS. Could save lives you're right. I've wanted them to get retested for a week or so but they've been stubborn."
I've tried but maybe with this new alert it'll be enough for them to get tested voluntarily.
I leave that crap disabled...
"Human error is always going to be baked into any system like this, eh. Can't really blame them as much as you can hope that the impact of the consequences are limited."
"That chain would have to have an early link that is either a border worker or someone who fluked their way through false negatives, yeah?"
there is little evidence for asymptomatic transmission. maybe low symptomatic chain.
"Well, they're *all* getting tested now to try and find the source so potentially not as often as would be ideal.

I'm sure they do get semi regular tests."
"Yeah but on this case there is no direct link to international travel, so everything on there to do with travel itself can probably be ruled out.

In general they're 100% weak points, there are *so* many. 100% inevitable.

Can describe my mood rn as disappointed but confident, eh.

Edit: Guys, I'm obviously not saying the virus just appeared in the community out of nowhere. I'm saying the people who tested positive don't have a direct link to international travel themselves. They will have got it from someone who got it form someone who may- likely someone who is under less of a microscope in terms of testing and contract tracing (like staff at the hotels)."
I'm just grateful it took this long. Gave the country lots of time to be prepared. We fought off worse odds last time it reared it's head!
"Well, no test is 100% accurate. Even if there's a minuscule chance of it happening, and I mean extremely miniscule, it is a non-zero chance.

Their physiology causing false negatives is more likely, but also a fluke."
Maybe they bought a fake test?
"Idk about that. It would have to be extremely low level spread to go undetected over such a long period, and if the virus had stayed in the community for 3 months it'd be near impossible for it to not expecting spread exponentially."
"Seems unlikely, the R value is sufficiently high that it would be completely rampant by now if that is the case. Remember that growth of cases is exponential rather than linear- it’s why we all need to work hard to kick covid back out."
"This! I'm so frustrated at hearing people say oh I was sick but I know it's not covid cos excuse A,B,C. Just get fucken tested as soon as you feel sick you selfish pricks, don't just assume it's not!"
Definitely can't see any unintended consequences to that one

Surgical masks are readily [available online](https://www.capesmedical.co.nz/medical-products/infection-prevention-control/masks/face-mask-3ply-earloops) but I notice that the price has more than doubled since I bought some last week. I appreciate the power of supply and demand, but a 105% price hike on a super common essential item in just a few days?"
I hope that seeing how bad it can get will help us realise how important is to be vigilant.
"Haha, fuck. Thanks for that laugh."
"Aye, a stone is a solid effort! I put on 3kg last lockdown and worked insane hours while snacking on junk food. This time I'm doing it right: making time to make proper meals and to exercise. Gonna lose those 3kg... but might need longer than 3 days."
And there was me thinking I really should do something about shifting these Covid kilos. Nah it can wait.
Feels real motherfucking slow to me xd

It's common in some religious groups and cultures. My grandparents were both 3 days and we're Catholic. It stems from the days before we could preserve a dead body for longer with refrigeration and embalming.
Had my Nanna died about 2 hours earlier her funeral would have been within 3 days.

"I have a friend who got sick. Called, was told to stay home, then mentioned where she worked. Rushed in for a test, because someone from a cruise ship had been there. 

Just a bad cold, fortunately.

But yeah, we're on this much faster, so I'm less scared than last time."
F
Release us as intended I assume. We have 2 negative covid tests over 14 days so we’re safe.
TBH tomorrow noon seems unnecessarily late
I only have 2 rolls of TP :(
You guys just have the most tremendous morons 😉
Yep. Couldn't agree more
">	We all know the drill, let’s just get it done now.

Yes, your government has done extremely well managing the crisis but it is this attitude by its citizens that has made the difference between success and failure.  

My hat is off to you from America.  I wish your people’s attitude would take hold here.  As a country we used to think like this.  I lament its loss.

[What we deal with instead are troglodytes like this.](https://reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/i7deyv/these_people_wont_learn/)"
Because people are idiots.
"Good to see a lot of sensible comments here.

Hell yeah bro
"And again, and again, and again. 

This is gonna a few times a year every year until a vaccine is out."
"New Zealand: 0 cases for a very long time, 22 deaths overall, and just went to level 3 lockdown over a localized incident. Smart.

U.S.: Still cranking out 1000 deaths a day and pretending it’s normal. Stupid. Like you, and the president that’s feeding you lies and conspiracies he hears from Putin and Xi. You’re an embarrassment to Americans"
Bit of a difference buddy
"Maybe it's your phone, I did in Christchurch."

Neither. One of my flatmates did and the other didn't either.
Got it in Hamilton.
"I literally had my first day back today lol, typical"
"It’s true, we still have half of a 20kg bag of flour left.

Wasn’t really panic buying it tho, more so buying what was available (it was a 20kg bag or nothing thanks to consistently empty supermarket shelves)"
"That’s the right mentality to have. You beat it once, you can definitely beat it again."
"Yeah thought about going in for a breakfast pie, But its just not worth it though. 
It will make that Pie i have after we beat covid again taste all that much better."
Yeah nah. Thats why he can't go to the bakery for a feed tomorrow cuz.

"This would be legit. Good old kiwi enterprise to the rescue. I could see there being a good whack of red tape to cross (there always is), but definitely worth exploring"
"Yea if anything the bragging you see will be within nz communities, with the vibe being more of a shared team victory instead of a ""look at us"". Sure the news of no new cases is pretty much unheard of in the world so it becomes big news, so I guess that how people get the impression we are bragging."
I wish our country had news that broadcast what other countries are doing. We're just needlessly letting so many suffer.

It’s funny to think you and your group of Americans wouldn’t be a hundred times louder and more smug if we had 0 cases lmao. Such hypocrites."
"fucking cringelord, just shut up"
You're right -- no one can compare to how spectacularly America is failing to contain the coronavirus. You are world leaders in infections.
NZ has both good leadership and a few lucky circumstances (e.g. size). The effective leadership is what the US needs and is severely lacking. Easy to be smug when there’s a court jester playing the part of US president.
"If you're a troll, well done. If not.. Jesus, what a sad sack moron."
"> You’re not even close to our size and demographic

Let's be honest, the problem with the US response has never been ""we have amazing leadership in the WH and a perfectly crafted plan to respond to COVID, but we just have too many people and too much diversity to make it work perfectly"".  That argument is completely bogus.  The only diversity we have that is causing an issue is the diversity of intelligence and ideologies that has left us with a mass of idiots who are an anchor weighing down our society."
"Absolutely, its a stupid comparison to make, tbh most people I see praising nz arent smug kiwis but Americans firing shots at their own governments response and going, ""nz did it, look how incompetent we are"" and then since it bashes orange man the upvotes flood in. We have every advantage to eliminate the virus and for a while we did, now we just have to do it again. If you look closer I don't think you will find many smug kiwi's, if there are I am willing to bet its because they are proud of our response and how everyone did their bit to control the spread."
Jfc give it a rest
"As an American, you can go to fucking hell.

New Zealand has proven that they can compare to us, and put us to shame. Hell, the majority of the world has proven that they can shame us. We are literally the richest country and the virus has completely destroyed us. Our economy is completely wrecked, millions will soon be evicted, our government can't even pass a second stimulus after 10 weeks, and people are still dying in mass.

There are very few countries that can't be smug about how much better they are handling the virus. The Kiwi's are at the top of the list."

Yeah. This is not a 3 day thing.
Yeah my bet is 3 days they'll test as much as possible then extend it at least another 1-2 weeks.
"it's for 3 days whilst they work out what level to stick at or if we go to level 4  it's going to be way longer than 3 days 

As a result, Auckland moves to level 3 restrictions from 12 noon tomorrow. The restrictions will last three days until midnight Friday. The rest of New Zealand will move to level 2 at the same time.

""These three days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have wide-spread contact tracing,"" Ardern said.

Aucklanders are asked to stay home to stop the spread. ""Act as if you have Covid and the people around you have Covid.""

There is no clear failure that caused this and, in 3 days, they are potentially back to living their normal lives again because they have a good plan and the people are on board, which seems to be a combination of better leadership at the very top and a more rational and intelligent society overall.

Not pretty much. Same thing happened in vietnam. Turns out testing wasnt high enough to find it. Suspect same is true for NZ

yeah no fucking way things go back to normal in 3 days. Wonder if the contact tracing will be completed in that time for this single case/family.
I agree with you. Will be two weeks minimum I reckon if they get all the tracing that is. I'm in Hamilton and I'd say we will be in level 3 by the end of the week.
3 days of level 3 while they contact trace. Then when they find nothing it'll be full blown level 4 nation wide.
Hahaha
You're right. We should do a half-assed effort like Victoria and fuck the economy anyway AND have people get sick and die.

More like we showed up to the test with all the answers in our pocket and then decided to get high in the bathroom
Same... I thought 17% was more indicative of the response but this makes more sense lol
"They'll reassess after 3 days, it's not like ""3 days then you can all go out and lick doorknobs"""
They plan to do tracing during that time. Would be nifty if all cases were traced within three days
"I'm guessing this is just the start. Level 3 lets the contact tracing teams get out and work in force and lets mass testing be done. 

If they find additional cases get ready for Auckland to get juiced back to level 4."
Can be extended
"Screw them. We have a situation where people are seriously complaining that setting up temporary overflow hospitals that were not needed is now a waste of money. However the government can spend trillions of dollars in corporate bailout, and that's completely acceptable.

I got a text from the uni just after 11 pm saying all face to face teaching was canceled. Seems odd that they notified the students but not the staff...
First year at university and I haven't been home since February. I guess I'm kinda used to it this way. Spent lockdown at my hall drinking an absurb amount and sleeping at the strangest hours.

"Californian here as well. Even our state isn’t nearly as good as New Zealand. Obviously not good that they have to shut down again, but reading this post made me think about what would happen if we somehow completely eradicate the virus in a few months, if we would shut back down over just a few new cases. 

No, we wouldn’t. We’re too worried about the economy than the lives of the people that drive it."

I don't think you were allowed to get tested unless you could prove you had contact from overseas or worked in a hot-spot. That's what I got told from my doctor a month or so ago anyway

Aye - there's still tomorrow morning to look after anything that'll be banned at midday. Though I wouldn't want to be trying to shop in Auckland tomorrow!
I really do hope so. But there are talks that the government doesn't want to risk a proper lockdown due to unemployment rate soaring through the roofs.

If it is reasonably contained though, they should be able to finish the contact tracing by Friday and if it hasn't spread far, I'd expect the rest of the country to go back to level 1 and Auckland to be on level 2 for a couple more weeks. I definitely don't see Auckland going back to level 1 by the weekend, and if it has spread outside Auckland and they can't find the edges of where the cases stop we could all be back in level 4 next week.

We need to consider that South Korean case again, did they really pick it up in transit, or could they be linked to this case? Also the case in Japan at the weekend that our government hasn't acknowledged yet."
I reckon 2 weeks if they trace more cases?
How do you know that?
Thank you for helping me confirm my understanding
Auckland is level 3 the rest is level 2
"Rest of country not auckland, so level 2. Sorry if I was confusing"
"Yeah it looks like it‘s a case of botched quarantine, I can’t imagine how it got in otherwise.

"They have been warning about it for weeks, that they knew weeks ago and didn't saying anything seems very unlikely."
I saw him typing on a phone with his hands under the podium during the press conference.
I mean I’ve never seen them in he same room
He Reddit’s while he holds conferences. It’s why you don’t see his hands.
He had actually secretly been in the country for months during lockdown (along with a couple of friends) and they decided to pay for a concert as a gift to NZ.
He spent lockdown here and planned the concert to thank the country for hosting him.
I don’t recommend anyone even interface with this dude their comments are a dead giveaway they’re just another alt right american
"Theyre still very well coordinated for an island of 5 million. The key message is that they are taking a good approach that works for them, unlike many other countries who think its a hoax or the people dont care about potentially spreading the disease and killing others and ""toughing it out"". Its the mentality that is being used to approach the situation that is worth some merit. 
Theyre not amazing nor heroes but they are doing the best they can without undermining efforts to contain the virus and thats what distinguishes that little island from lots of others. For example, Hawaii has over 3000 active cases and it's  even more isolated than NZ and has less people. Its just being poorly managed by a poor government and people that follow it. Use you brain man jesus."
"Their approach to this pandemic would be more effective than the current approach in the US and other countries struggling to manage their cases and deaths. Do you disagree with that or do you think the US is taking the optimal approach to managing this public health crisis, or is there an option 3 that you’re thinking of?"
"I understand that. However, they are putting resources into contact tracing, testing, and isolation. I work in infectious disease Epidemiology in the US. We are not doing that because individual states are either not taking it seriously or because we have not been given sufficient federal funding. To do contact tracing in my state, we had to ask people to volunteer after work to do so because we just didnt have the man power. Furthermore, the politicization of the pandemic is causing further harm. Our leaders are directly contributing to the morbidity and mortality from COVID because of out non-response. 

Yes, the situation is different, but the model should still be adapted to our situations. We have seen its possible to get this under control, and now we should take more serious steps to do so"

It’s an example of the power constitution unions hold. There should be stricter limits if were serious about stopping the spread - am I wrong in thinking plenty of blokes on site might not take the mask deal seriously all the time?"

Returning Kiwis don't pay if they're here to stay. If you left after the law change and come back you have to pay. Also if you come back then leave again you pay on exit. Everyone else pays regardless.

Interesting point. I wouldn’t say I’m numb personally but then again I was raised and am still deeply connected to a place that has a social safety net and I’m not white/ so I have that counterbalance in my DNA. But yes I see the complacency esp amongst white folks here - even those white poor who are adversely affected (this works so long as there’s another group of people - preferably brown or black) to blame their troubles on (it ain’t been touted as the ‘China Virus’ by you know who for nothing!). It’s one giant game of ‘look at that shiny object over there!’  A generation of shittastic corporate K-12 curriculum got a lot to answer for! IMO racism and foundational individualism (rights over responsibility) are the original sins of this country and nothing gets better til they’re dealt with. Change in power will give us space to breath but won’t fundamentally change anything. Complacency in certain quarters is logical given the history and context.

"To further your point, the research out of Europe suggests that, using Italy as a case study, the virus had been circulating undetected since 2019. Obviously the fact the world didn't really know what it was had a part to play in this, but the believe it was largely transmitted via asymptomatic carrier's. Thats pretty f'n scary as it implies it never left NZ."

"Who cares if it's easy?  You complain as if there's some aspect of fairness to all this.

It's a valid comparison because in a single article we have a good summary of the governmental response at containing the spread in their country.

What is the national strategy that we (I am an American) have implemented?  Because right now the message from above seems to be "" Don't worry about it, one day it's just going to be gone."" That's not a fucking plan.

See that's the problem with good leadership, it makes hard things look easy, and that makes simple people question why we need good leadership."
It's less about the location of New Zealand and more about how the government is dealing with it.  Look at how NZ's government is handing just 4 cases compared to the leadership of the US during the initial stages?  Part of the reason why NZ's cases were so low is because of the governments stern and strong response.

"I dunno if I'd take ""more immunity"", well below the threshold required for meaningful heard immunity, at the cost of an equivalent death rate to the US.

You're essentially arguing that we should have let deaths occur earlier, when worse preparation increased their number, to prevent some undefined crisis situation whereby a delayed, not even guaranteed, second wave is somehow worse.

That and as another user pointed out to you, we already had community transmission.

I see no reason why this lockdown will be longer than the previous, let alone indefinite.

I get feeling defensive about how the US has handled this, because how else can you possibly address that? But stop. We know what we are doing, how hard it will be and that it is worth it.

Lol it is not going to be three days. Best case scenario they trace it back to a recent arrival and we get away with a few weeks at level 2. More likely it's a few weeks at level four.

"I do,  but it came through still -- sound and all. Google pixel 4."
"People are either panicking or coming up with conspiracies - I am addressing that, rather than the government response which I think is right.

What I am saying is that while serious, it should hopefully be a recoverable situation once they track and trace as far as they can and test, test, test due to the fact that there are no hospitalisations as yet. That is indication that it hopefully hasn't spread far enough."
"Unfortunately people are still going out and panic buying. There's more stupid people out there than I think any of us are comfortable with. Hopefully it's a good stupid though, and they stay the fuck at home."
"Fuck knows.

If it was an escapee infecting a supermarket, just one family getting it seems unlikely, so more cases will show up and they'll track it back to the source.

We've all been acting as if no community transmission mesns the virus was extinct in NZ. It's possible this guy just had really bad luck, and ran into enough to be infected.

Maybe it's been hiding out in some asymptomatic carrier who's mostly been careful.

All I know for sure is the government kept saying this could happen, and kept being accused of scare mongering."
I reckon it was those escapees.
"That's the big question.  Either it came via someone involved with quarantine, or it come from someone involved in the airport or transport."
That's the big old ? Isn't it. I imagine that's why it's only level 3 for 3 days as of now so they can track and trace. If they can't find the source within those few days id expect auckland or perhaps even the whole of NZ to move to level 4.

Also the misinformation just adds to the confusion and debate. We need to quit acting like every small bit of evidence is 100% proven. It just adds fuel to the disorganized fire."
"On an American made website aimed at a global audience on a British and Swiss made platform on a NZ specific sub. 

But the joke that I’m guessing you’re oblivious to is that there’s a joke around at least some parts of the world about Americans constantly talking about themselves and how they’re American unprompted."
"Nah I have nothing against them for the timing. They tried to increase it before the last rent freeze, it was due to take effect about 3 weeks after the rent freeze began. My issue was how much the fuckers were trying to increase my rent by. But then I checked the listings and... damn... rent in my area had gone up heaps in the last year."
"Selfish maybe, but you dont know his situation, just like we dont know the situation on that would be ~6%."
In the last L4/3 lockdown they paid employers to keep people employed.
Fuck socks. Inevitable i guess.

I am dual citizen of NZ currently residing in the US. That would not be ideal for me as I like to browse this subreddit to stay up to date with NZ news.
It's not like moderators have the ability to do that either
why would you shit on NZ for this? They're being proactive. You're a fucking moron.
"Take a scroll through the comments and tell me how many comments on this r/NewZealand post involve the words ""As an american""

I'll give you a hint: Far too many for a post that doesn't involve the US in the slightest.

It's fucking obnoxious, keep your nose out of other people's business for once."
You can do it without posting.

"Called healthline last week, they refused me a test with cold like symptoms because I had no connections to overseas travel. Not so easy to get a test, I'm 100% willing to get a test just to be safe."

"Which is why I've stayed home for over a week and sought medical advice which didn't amount to anything. Thanks for your criticism though, it's much appreciated."

Implying KFC isn't essential
">This is new level 3 only essential services and kfc

And a whole tonne of trade jobs that can be done socially distanced and can't be done from home. Tens of thousands more people can work in level 3 that can't at 4"
"Excuse you, KFC is an essential service."
"I read the official Covid-19 website which outlined what level 3 is, and it's different to what she said. I know the rest of the country is a level lower."
"Oh true, I forgot that estimate about having 10x more cases than are detected. Luckily my partner just cooked a week's worth of shepherd's pie earlier today, so as long as we don't run out of shit tickets we good to stay home the next while"
"I’m so confused, how it’s been contracted if the household that have it had no recent travel. Maybe confused is the wrong word, but you get what I mean."
Whatever it takes
Unsure what your thoughts are here.
"Thank you, and yeah we can't get our shit together here. I wish you well as well!"
You're right. It could be from complacent ppe use at a quarantine facility
"All of the compassionate exemptions, people escaping, complacent ppe usage at isolation facilities has now bitten us in the bum"
Because it is a known fact that only low iq people get covid.

Mine was hesitant in the past but I can ask again
"When i was listening to Magic Talk earlier, they were absolutely furious with people saying they weren't going to lockdown. ZB was strangely calm."
Someone who works in the quarantine hotels seems the most likely. Maybe just a simple chap who delivers goods or something.

"Honestly I’m not feeling very hopeful. We were lucky we went in hard to begin with so we didn’t have to deal with any of the anti-mask dumbasses but now if we get a resurgence, I doubt we’d be able to contain it as well as we did before."
Please tell us more soothing things
Stuff currently have an link to another older alert level plan that is quite different.  I wish they would sort there shit out.
"Nice. There's a box there that suggests an update is forthcoming on ""masks"". Not sure if that will utilize ""face coverings"" language when it does. Again, GOOD JOB NEW ZEALAND."
"I would agree that any cloth face covering is better than none. Then if needed swap makeshift face coverings for better ones. There's some likelihood that even two years from now, the world will keep masks on standby for the next inhaled virus thread. Then the whole world can get NZ's outcomes - virus vanquished ahead of vaccine at the start of wave one.

I'm bitter the UK didn't mobilize citizen sewing machines in early March for country-wide delivery to all at the start of April. You know, swap the boats of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ships_of_Dunkirk for sewing machines and keep the them busy until done (loaned out, if needed)."
"Well this changes things doesnt it.
Good luck to y'all"
"Yea that is what I remember too.
But they are saying all non-essentials have to close. I will need to check with my company in the morning."
Yeah definitely worked through both phases of level 3 last time so unless something has changed I don't see why that wouldn't be the  same
Thanks i love sailing
I’m going to say oui
Cardrona & TC is closed tomorrow (Wednesday) to re-evaluate and plan what is going to happen
"Awesome, fingers crossed then."
"I mean, congrats NZ. Y'all jumped into action and locked down your entire country over 4 people. The US meanwhile has thousands dying per day and are trying to re-open the country like nothing is happening."
Agreed. Why is America the hot topic here?! I came here to read about how this is being handled in NZ and what locals think and how they are affected.

"As an American, you'll probably feel worse when you contract Coronavirus"
"As an American, I feel bad for the people of the USA. Some have been convinced that a man who puts on an obviously fake spray tan that everything about him is real, even his words, even if they are all such obvious lies like his very appearance with as much scientific backing as a Facebook minions post.  They've been convinced that instead of trying to help themselves and their fellow Americans that a better goal worth pursuing, regardless of the cost to themselves and their long-term future, that helping line the pockets of executives and stakeholders in the short-term in exchange for a smaller workforce in the future from the deaths and a weakened workforce from the potentially lifetime damage a preventable and controllable pandemic causes even to those that don't die.

TLDR:  Put some more thought and research into your thinking, maybe a but more than a couple of minutes of reading minions posts from Facebook ya jackwagon."
"As a fellow American I feel bad for you and your defeatist nature.  Throwing the towel in at the slightest threat to your individual freedom is the coward's way out.  No one in New Zealand is trying to eradicate the disease through isolation.  The goal is to buy time to discover viable treatments. How much is life changing disability worth? How much is a human life worth? Going about your life and hoping nothing bad happens to you alone is unfortunately the epitome of the world's view on America. 

If it makes you feel better, you have my thoughts and prayers."
Just read that NZ' has put 6.7% of children into poverty due to their insane containment measures. I would rather in my shithole american city than anywhere in APAC right now especially AU/NZ.

"Border management was just too slack , too soft.

Minimum wage workers. Isolators not following the rules. 

Flight crew, diplomats not isolating.

Oh if only we could go back in time and do it properly."
considering we still have mandatory quarantine no. We did get a lucky break from all those exemptions and quarantine escapees but thought we would be safe for at least another month
Especially with the way borders were managed!
"true, we have been lucky to avoid it in the past given all the scares about escapees and exemptions"
"We worked through last time because we were scrambling to prepare for level 4 because our company didn't prepare at all, and wont have a plan this time. level 3 last time was only a few days as well."

"I'd like to bring up a quote from House M.D. :

""Everyone lies."""
"Found Dr. House.

Also, this is the most likely answer. Or at least I like this option better than the possibility of coronavirus being able to go dormant."
Most likely. I can’t think of any other reason other than “gOvT cOnSpIrAcY”.
Probably not.  What people don't want to talk about is the fact that covid just isn't deadly for the vast majority of people.  It's something like 30% are asymptomatic and the rest range from mild cough to low grade flu.  I imagine this is just the first case in a while that had more severe symptoms.
It starts with G and rhymes with covenant.
The new cases could also be lying about who they’ve been in contact with
" When's the last time you heard of somebody being punished for lying?

Even under oath, everybody is just a huge fucking liar,  you either get down with the charade or you will be the only person telling the truth out there. It's literally driving me fucking crazy."
"This. It’s always this. Humans will always be the cause for the fall of mankind. 

Always some idiot selfish human goes, yeah... I’m gonna skip quarantine since I know I don’t have it. What’s the harm... BAM"
Most likely. Hope they find the culprit soon. Else it’s gonna be the whole Melbourne sexy security guard case again.
"Just because the data is missing doesn't make it magical or a vast conspiracy.That's what science is, understanding the unknown."
"there are far more likely reasons for it getting over than ""the government/some secret group is trying to kill us"". 

it only ""came out of nowhere"" because the person who came over with it got through, billionaires going around on boats, private planes, mail being infected etc or one person lying and one person being lazy.

please don't do the ""it's a conspiracy"" nonsense."
"Why would some wide-ranging global conspiracy target New Zealand instead of Pakistan, the latter of which is far more embroiled in various world politics and far more important to destabilize for certain actors?"
"What’s more likely? That you have relatively little knowledge of virology and disease transmission or that there’s a global conspiracy involving millions of health and government officials to accomplish....nothing?

Just because you don’t understand something doesn’t mean it’s nefarious.

By the way, Pakistan isn’t some third world country, they reacted to the virus in early March and reached the peak of their curve in June."
"Occam’s Razor, dude. There is no conspiracy. And also... Pakistan? You think a government with such a heavy thumb is going to say anything OTHER than “we have this under control”? Get real lol"
"Pakistan went on an extremely agressive nationwide lockdown, boss.  No mystery here."
"I mean. I can understand why poor countries with poor systems would under-report their number of cases. I doubt that Pakistan really did flatten the curve. But New Zealand? They were handling it well, free mass tests, responsive government, corporative citizen. The only reason I could think why is there new cases suddenly is either one of the patients lied on where they went, or negligence"
"Incoming freight or hotel quarantine breach. Go with the logical explanations and look into contagious disease transmission, it is quite easy to spread highly infectious viruses if they get in and there have always been entry points in NZ (returning residents, imported goods and the people required to transport said goods)

As for Pakistan...lack of confirmed cases doesnt mean lack of cases (cant have/count cases if you dont test them), also, they locked down fairly hard."
"Coronavirus spreads the best in first world countries because of the service economy. Most people in Pakistan don't regularly go to restaurants to eat. They stay in their houses more, since the country is less safe to begin with and there isn't as much to do. There's less of an entertainment industry, so there's less reason to go anywhere for fun. I highly doubt there's significant tourism within the country. There are other diseases around so people there are already accustomed to washing hands as often as possible and avoiding areas/people who could be sick. The government already has policies in place for a pandemic as a result of previous outbreaks, which most first world countries don't. There are farmers in small towns who probably go two weeks without going into town and seeing anyone aside from family/neighbors to begin with. The first world lifestyle depends on much more interaction than the third world lifestyle, and as a result it spreads respiratory contagion much faster."
For normal people it’s time for kindness for Judith it is not. I feel very confident in hating Judith.
Same here. But I'm at polytech so I'm guessing you had a way worse experience during lockdown.
Im studying aswell. But im in chch and lockdown was okay considering im a 1st year IT student. But it wasn't great.
"New Zealand has roughly half of the population of New York City alone.

You are comparing apples to oranges."
So we can all get maximum spreading in until noon
"in fairness, we voted for a conservative nut job here in Ontario and he did a reasonably good job all things considered"
You can always count on them to fuck things up. I'd move if I could afford it. And also if we weren't living in a pandemic.
Conservative nut jobs win the electoral college and lose the popular vote. Gerrymandering works.

"Lol a few of us did, I was essential at my old job for a while but I was laid off in July since our industry will be affected for a long time. I stay home, garden, apply for jobs, and take care of my dogs and go out for groceries when I have to leave home.

"Oh I am pissed but at this point I can only do what I can while thinking about my safety and the safety of my family and friends. I have worked since I was 16 and this has been my first time being on unemployment. Some shit folks in the Senate who represent the freeloading states think enhanced unemployment assistance is keeping folks from returning to work but completely ignore that entire industries are dead until we have this virus under control is a nightmare. I try not to be depressed and think positively about it all but at this point our governor had the math done about our “president’s” Executive Order and basically laid out it will bankrupt the state and more citizens will be laid off. I do think that Americans need to be vocal about these issues and realize that these folks in power are basically saying to everyone “fuck you, I have mine and you don’t matter.”"
"What, realistically, could the President have done differently?"
It’s also a lot easier when you actually try.
"Yep, and an island where you it's easier to control who comes and goes."
It's almost as if being infected with the damn thing gives people the urge to travel.

Right. Wasn't trying to upset anyone love. Safety is always paramount. Hope you're ok.
"Either way it’s fucked. But that does not take away the fact that their doing a great job with a unprecedented virus and other countries could learn from them. It’s horrible, but facts. The US could prevented so much more."
How so?

Gods playing Pandemic the video game.
"That's if everyone who gets symptoms is tested. Also the number of infections doubles every 3 days or so, and there is typically about a ten day lag between infection and detection. If we assume that one in two cases has symptoms, and one in ten of those gets tested, we could easily be looking at a couple of hundred infections before a case is detected."
"I'll disagree here, every time I cook it gets fucked up even after following directions to the very last letter. I still eat the shitty food I make but its super depressing and frustrating for me to cook. Cooking is much much harder than people make it out to be.

Still no excuse not to try though! I made disgusting jalapeño poppers last night from a recipe I saw on youtube and ate every last one while fuming mad about them being gross."

Lol @ hate living in the US. You literally hit the lottery to be born here. Go on a mission trip or something to some shithole where they eat bush meat and shit in their drinking water and then reanalyze how good you really have it. The only thing that sucks here is the COST of healthcare.
Except for the fact that as of last week the MOH didn't know how many of the bus drivers taking people to managed isolation had been tested... That probably includes the security personnel ushering people into facilities.
"so 30,000 is a lot of airport interactions, and a lot of people to hold up their end of the bargain if I was a betting man.

"There was an article online that had stats about the number of people who left isolation w/o any testing. This was a couple of months back. I was stunned at the time because asymptomatic spread has become a huge deal here in the US. I don't have the link anymore.

Also, the concept of compassionate leave from MI is bunk. The virus doesn't have compassion."

"Rise of globalisation, was a matter of when, not if it happened."
"It sucks a bit less (so far) than past pandemics like, say, the Spanish flu or the black death, thanks to modern medicine.

"1. A report recently was leaked that employees in the quarantine chain (such as bus drivers) are only being tested once per fortnight and it should be a lot more. The MoH was ""considering the report"" rather than putting their ass into gear and doing the ""test, test, test"" thing.

2. A lot of testing stations aren't at capacity and still turn people away if they don't have symptoms. How do we know there's no asymptomatic cases if we aren't testing?"
Allowing planes to land from other countries.

"I'm pretty sure they got yelled at and told no during level 4. If you wanted to claim you were an essential supplier, you basically had to be trade accounts only and verify each order was essential, keep good records, and only have the minimum necessary staff.

Level 3 they can open for click and collect or one-in-one-out I think."
"All food processing was classed as essential services, which is a lot of our economy."
"Except they are talking about closing a bunch of stuff already, when contact tracing should be sufficient for now."
This implies that the people that returned did not quarantine for 14 days.
"> Borders have been closed to everyone except citizens and permanent residents

So... it's not closed to everyone except citizens?

Also, you forgot some non-permanent residents, relatives of residents, diplomats, film crews etc."
So what you’re saying is that the borders haven’t been closed to everyone except citizens
"The likelihood of having Covid isn't the point, the point is you can't legally refuse entry to citizens, but you can to everyone else."
"Closed except to citizens, residents and people with special work permits 

You can’t leave people stateless, hence leaving it open to citizens, but it should be closed to everyone else imo"
except for people who can bring in money like film crews etc...
Unless you have lots of money to make a movie
Unless you're a resident or relative of a resident or a diplomat or working on a movie or...
So you’re telling me no one with a resident visa or special work visa has been let in since March?
"They fucking aren’t.

People with resident and work visas have been let in since March"
"This. And keep in mind that some countries don’t allow for dual citizenship - in my case, I’m a German citizen, but I’ve lived here since 2005 and I’m still a resident because obtaining NZ citizenship would mean losing my EU passport.

There’s plenty of people in similar situations."
"Nope, residents and people with work visas have been let in"

"I’m in the States, so circumstances may be different, but I wipe down mail with isopropyl/water (put 3/4ths cup of Isopropyl in with a 1/4th of water to make an easy disinfectant) if it’s a package, because of the positive tests within Amazon.

It was and always has been. Also had to argue about the efficacy of masks use as a means to reduce transmission. If it turns out any of these new cases was due to asymptomatic spread or an undiscovered cluster, mask use *will* be recommended. It's not a coincidence Bloomfield changed the official tune recently."
"No, because it was obvious to anyone with half a brain and some critical thinking skills."
No thanks.
I think they are talking about the possibility that some infected people got past the borders.
If it was a breach that should have been easily avoided.
"1. A report recently came out employees in the quarantine chain (such as bus drivers) are only being tested once per fortnight and it should be a lot more. The MoH was ""considering the report"" rather than putting their ass into gear and doing the ""test, test, test"" thing.

2. A lot of testing stations aren't at capacity and still turn people away if they don't have symptoms. How do we know there's no asymptomatic cases if we aren't testing?"
I really hope it’s somehow it’s not widespread. I’m really worried now.
That's definitely what is causing the ridiculous late night rush of panic buying
Brownlee was saying the govt should come clean about their ramping up of Covid messaging yesterday
"That’s why I was asking... they’ve said this dude has been symptomatic for five days, and I’m not sure which day last week all the talk about masks popped up.

Could be coincidence."
90 odd days of nothing then it’s all ramped up again in the last week... either very convenient timing or...

No. Its 3 days to catch up and see where we are and to stop the spread. In 3 days we'll reassess
For now. It depends on successful contact tracing.

Where are you getting your figures? Last I checked it was short and limited. People showing no antibodies a month post-negative covid
That explains why I’ve never seen a bat in NZ before - we’re eating them all
"Agreed.

I have no idea what they could’ve done more, or what more people could’ve expected. We still lowered our cases substantially, and we’ll continue to beat it if we follow the plan. I’m no where near as surprised as a lot of folks here are - they told us time and time again to expect more cases, and now we’ve got some. Time to buckle down and get to work again."

I would of thought as soon as someone not in isolation tested positive then Ardern would of been notified. Instead they wait to test the whole family before telling her.

Edit.
Looks like they knew earlier in the day and maybe delayed press conference from 8pm till 9.15pm to get families results."
So last week was when everyone decided that masks were effective?
It was Ashley Bloomfield telling people to be prepared for a second wave

It’s not supposed to be. It’s until a vaccine essentially can be rolled out.

Of course you'll have low cases in that scenario, that is not surprising.  Are they measuring the impact these ridiculous policies are having on everything else in their society, or is having low Covid numbers the only important metric for success nowadays?

I see in a reply you say most people in the US can leave their homes. With the exception of a month earlier this year, and somewhat localised restrictions for what may be as little as a few days now, so can all Kiwis.

Health professionals are generally pretty unified on what countries ought to do to prevent mass death, but this doesn't fit with most current government's platforms or rhetoric, hence lines of tenuous argument for inaction like this one."

Because we're smart enough to realize that lockdowns don't work. New Zealand is just delaying the inevitable. The virus will return after this lockdown ends too.
"So New Zealand's initial hardcore lockdown was completely useless.  At that stage the goal was to eliminate, not slow the spread."
A lockdown destroys the economy and mental wellbeing in exchange for delaying the spread of the virus. But it will never stop the virus. You'll be locking down for years at this rate; isolated from the rest of the world with a sharp increase in mental illnesses.

"Alternatively, big sad. Lack of social structure which has been rigorously proven worthwhile the world over has been a known issue, but to have hundreds of thousands die over it all around us is really hard to watch."
"I'd say I'm feeling a mixture of anger, sadness and fascination watching what a cohesive national response looks like."
not everyone can get by 'just not working for a few days' tbf
"Serious question: are you required (as in forced) to stay at home when getting tested? Can't you just get the test and work anyway? I mean it's obviously better to stay at home when you have symptoms but if you're going anyway, getting voluntarily tested is still preferable, no?"
Well that's shit. No wonder there's community transmission now :/

I really feel for you shits been rough for everyone I know in the industry. I was supposed to go on tour in AUS/NZ March 17th. Instead I got stuck in a hotspot in California with my only other option being Florida. I’ve resigned to the fact that I won’t work in the industry again until late 2021 or even 2022 at this rate. This is the longest I’ve been off the road in years and I’m going stir crazy.
RIGHT NOW.
According to the COVID-19 NZ website that number is 24 hours
Do it now - definitely. You dont need to be ashamed enough to wait. I mean that in the best way. All the best for your family
Can't hurt to try call now.
"I'm calling it now, I've been on wait for 30 minutes and there was 460+ calls ahead of me"
Available 24/7 apparently :)
I believe it’s 24 hrs (not 100%). Give it a go but might be busy atm in the lines so maybe the morning is your best bet

"If it turns out that it was due to poor quarantine management I *really* hope the army takes the reigns, completely."
"Minimum wage workers, some who barely speak English with no medical training, little education and some so fatigued working multiple jobs they can't stay awake let alone stay alert. 
What could go wrong?"
"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/08/10/asymptomatic

Seems like there’s plenty of evidence given this data and what was measured."
Previously they were not tested routinely.
"Covid can't just spawn from the ground. It had to have been by some interaction with an international arrival at some point by someone. 

That's not entirely true. You can have covid and go undetected. I work in one of the front line teams mentioned above. Hundreds of people do, it only takes one infection and then to spread without knowing and you have a case that isn't ""linked to international"" travel"
"I think no link to international travel referred to the infected people haven’t been overseas. They are testing all the workers in the quarantine hotels etc so it must have come through that way. It can’t just appear. 

My money is on a worker at one of the many quarantine hotels. It’s been 100 days, I’m sure they’ve started getting a little less rigorous over time."
"I was hoping we'd make it until Christmas and thinking we'd make it until October personally.

Based on absolutely nothing but my gut. Obviously. Don't take my thoughts more seriously than Internet ramblings warrant."
"Yes, I would assume a double false negative tbh, no test can be 100% sure and the more people that come through the more likely it is that a rare thing happens."
You also would see it pop up in hospitals which has not happened.
"Low level spread seems completely viable. If it happened in a populated area, we’d know because of a faster spread. If it happened in an isolated area amongst people who rarely interact with others, it could brew for months without anyone noticing until someone in that area decides to travel to Auckland.

After all, these people would feel far more protected from it and would absolutely not suspect it due to their small and rarely visited social circles."
"Apparently in France they retested some swabs taken from a sick man in December and found the virus there, which puts the virus in France months earlier than they thought.."
"Sometimes hard to tell if you just didn't get a good nights sleep, drank/smoked too much vs being sick. Who knows if they had ALL the symptoms. It could have been a gradual thing and they didnt really start feeling ill until 4-5 days in. When I have the flu I'm only sick for 2-3 days."
"As someone living in a place with more covid cases a day than NZ has had total I can understand the anger that this has happened . 

But kindness and compassion is going to go along way. Try to dial it down and think about how you can help the less fortunate ride out the next bout."
I could really do with an extra $1500 right now...
How do they even believe that? I bet they're the ones that go and stockpile the toilet paper too.

"That last person consents to a lockdown but not a vaccine? 

Actually I don’t want to try and understand them. They lost me at “plandemic” I wonder if they could say that to someone whose family member died?"
"Hey, at least the last person consents to lockdown. Not much else though!"
Wow that's crazy
Get better friends.
"So what, the government didn't want control when they ended the first lockdown but after 100 days they what, got bored?"
They should just look at the US for what the opposite looks like
Could we offer them a place on another island instead? Ooh a continent even. Antartica.
MAGA?  Make Auckland Great Again LOL
Why should we all suffer when we're perfectly able to let a large chunk of the country continue life as normal? That's like saying we should stay in full isolation in solidarity with kiwis overseas.
"Realistically, it will be another four weeks. Hard though it seems the best bet is the same approach as last time."
For sure. It’s just like the first time when they said for a few weeks and then kept dragging it out and extending it.

We don't elect them. They buy their spots. Really not much to do about it short of a civil conflict
"Really? That's a shame, I'm not from NZ and I thought you guys were doing a pretty fucking good job personally. It's sad this has happened after doing so well."
"Do you think that is really it?  No one should get this virus.  Full stop.      The fact that  NZ has been held up as this utopia where a ""democratic-socialist did everything right US BAD NZ GOOD!!"" has made people with half brain realize that there is a wacko political agenda being pushed hard.   


No one should get this virus.   Everyone should remain cautious. 

  It is easier for a small, island country, with limited flights and ports to lockdown and trace the source.     There is no politics in that.    The fact that some people think the US could have done anything differently are pushing an agenda."

I’ve left the house only to pick up groceries since March. You’re lucky you live somewhere where the population actually cares to follow guidelines. Lots of us have been trying for a long time and will continue doing so even though it makes no difference at this point.

"Congrats on the job! And the diet
May job is also essential and very strict about alert levels so tomorrow will be interesting to say the least. But my contract ends in 4 weeks then I am moving city with no work lined up....will be an outright pain to find new work in this environment.

Pasta is lasagna sheets with layers of cubed chicken/spinach/garlic. A cheese bechamel. And another layer of grilled mushrooms/onion/herbs&grated celeriac. It is deeply enjoyable!"

Zero direct links.
Vietnam was illegal workers being smuggled over the border.
"So you think, for a 100 days there was on going community transmission and generations of this hyper contiguous virus, where no one got sick enough to got sick enough to talk to their GP or call help line? That's absurd."

Wtf that's crazy
I saw health workers at a local clinic in full PPE this arvo.
"True, of course. Ahhhh when will they learn???"
You didn't master your sourdough game last lockdown?  (But in all seriousness good luck with the food situation)
"It'll be back to limit 1 or 2. There should be enough. I'm annoyed was about to stop in and get some bread, soap and toilet paper on the way home. But figured I'd just go tomorrow, got home and the announcement was underway."
If they find the link to the border it could all be contained pretty quickly. If not we won't know how bad it is for a few weeks.
I and everyone else I know are predicting this scenario
I’m not saying that. Quarantine was a joke. And the government should have invested more time and thought into it.
It’s too late. We will be at 100 cases this Friday. It’s been in the community for some time. Government has been too dumb to realise that.
Our work implemented a strict sick policy before lockdown began that is still in place. Even if you have a runny nose or slight cough you aren't allowed to come in. Can believe other places aren't doing the same.
There are other viruses than COVID
"No, that will be tests completed.

Not positive results."

Yep. Its RNZ and Wiggles for the kids in our car and thats it.
Your committing self-harm. If I were in NZ i'd get the official government information and then try and find something else to do.  Being on social media during a time like this is just a recipe to increase your anxiety and have an even worse time.

"How they ever expected to get to 4000 tests a day with such restrictive criteria I have no idea. Bloomfield's up there every day acting like it was our fault for refusing tests.

edit: Also by that criteria the person who tested positive wasn't eligible for a test. No contact with a known case, no international travel, no connection to the border. I really want to know if this was actually the policy or if some people were given the wrong information and this person was just lucky or persistent."

If you didn't have symptoms you needed a reason as such you mentioned or if you are vaunerable or in close contact with people who are."

"No, it says people who meet the Higher Index of Suspicion criteria *must* be tested and must self isolate while waiting for results. People who don't meet that criteria but have symptoms should be offered a test but they don't have to self isolate while waiting for results."

I've asked my Waikato guys that work in Auckland to return home safely but work remote and not come into the Waikato office.
Oh man that sucks do you know if that means you can't go to work?
It was a press question and bloomfield stated as such
"Bloomfield, during the conference when specifically asked about those cases."
"I fully understand, we're all affected in one way or another. Sending positive vibes is my thing till I fall asleep tonight :)"
"Trying to find link from the usa for homemade masks. Apparently chiffon combined with egyptian cotton sheets (600+ thread count)...I’ll just email john key, see if he’s got any old sheets"
I don't think they've given enough time for everyone to get hold of masks.
I reckon they’re trying to track a source of transmission in the next three days and if they can’t then it’ll be 2 more days of level three before going to level 4 on monday
I just hope they still play albeit without a live crowd. I guess they'll see how many more cases pop up by Friday.
"No, as in about 16,000 people died in a few months, in a state with around 9 million people."
"Thats great but when something shows up on the front page, the vast majority of people seeing it are American"
"It's a small number of deaths. Probably over 99.9% of us will be here next year. I don't think you have a right to prevent children from going to school because you got fat. And yes, in America most of the people that are hospitalized are fat, heart disease, diabetes, etc. Even without that -- you just don't have a right to shutdown society. 

Sorry that it offends you that children have rights too."
I'm in Wellington and got nothing 😣
Regular flus and even things like Rota/Noro virus are deadly in an elderly population
Yeah well pretend you are living in Auckland and follow those guides.
Don’t forget your hand sanitizer
"Probably knew about a possible case, but were waiting for results to confirm. They can't release information too early or else people would just panic and leave the area, making it even more of a nightmare to control"
😭
"Pak n save is where I got mine, box in the first aid area"
"Maybe I'm a pessimist; but for Covid to have reached these people with no obvious connection to travel or isolation facilities, there must be dozens or hundreds of cases waiting to be found."
"Even when covid is knocking on their doorstep they still don’t care. My boyfriend’s mom is a huge die-hard trump supporter. A few months ago her dad literally died of covid, and she still gets mad anytime my boyfriend criticizes trump. And she wants everything to open back up. It’s baffling to watch."
"Some problems? Have you seen this shit show? This isn't some problem, this is mass death caused by stupidity"
"TIL that causing dozens of thousands of preventable deaths because of arrogance, stupidity, and a massive bungling of bureaucracy constitutes “some problems.”

I love these dumbasses who engage in some a full-throated defense of a country that couldn’t give less of a shit about them, including if they’re American. If you aren’t it just makes it even more embarrassing, because you have no stake in the game and generally just have no idea what the fuck you’re talking about. 

How about you give a cogent defense instead of crying about how people are being too mean to a country they actually live in? Are you capable of that?"
"its due to our hubris of ""america first"" that we've fucked ourselves with"
Fucking seriously. Every country is shitty.
"He literally doesn't need to do anything to cover it up. 30% of the country has decided to give up on facts and science, at least 50% + (largely overlapping the last group) can't tell the difference between facts and fiction."
"I mean, just take up piracy on the high seas at that point."
Yeah then you should be fine
Like... a cruise ship?
Try living in North Korea
Germany's one is still considered pretty shit.
If it doesn't work at least get Rippl without all that login bullshit
"Eh?? My history shows I used it 9 different places yesterday, it worked every time.  


The only time I have had an issue is if they have either  
A) Put the sign up somewhere stupid.. eg on a sliding/auto door.  
B) It has been laminated and it's really sunny."
Legend
How do you know? Source?
"I'd be happier if they knew where this had come from, though it's a safe bet some dickhead re-entering the country couldn't be arsed following all the rules. It was only a matter of time. It's also a wakeup call to get our useless tracing app sorted."
">Auckland is considered to be Wellsford to Pukekohe.

>Roadblocks will be in place.

>People in Auckland must stay home to stop the spread. Act as if you have COVID. Stay at home in your bubble.

>You must work from home unless you're an essential service worker.

>All schools to close except for the children of essential service workers.

>All public facilities, bars, restaurants must close.

>Gatherings are restricted including weddings, funerals etc.

>Travelling in and out of Auckland is prohibited.

>If you are in Auckland and dont reside there typically, you can return home, but be careful.

This is far and away more ""shut down"" compared to ANYTHING the US is doing currently. And this is for 4 cases, immediately when they are detected."
"Great idea, let's all just ignore the absolutely worthless, blundering response of our government and just leave instead of trying to fix it. Get the fuck out of here with that, you know it's a non-solution. You can be disappointed in your country without leaving the country."
Would if I could. Other countries don't want us and I don't blame them
Try moving when you have no life savings like most Americans and are dependent on a job in your area. Not everyone is rich like people in Manhattan who have 2nd homes in the Hamptons.
"Yes I have. And no, it's not really understandable to be honest. In fact, it's quite unbelievable to me that there are people that can see all of the data we have available and think ""nah that's a hoax"" even from the very beginning. That's not just stupidity... It's blatant disregard for reality."
Yeah I love people like this who think everywhere is Nebraska.

"I agree, however in all seriousness I would prefer more focus on teaching people how to think about more than one thing at a time, including processing multiple, seemingly oppositional facts and developing fluid conclusions and opinions that are more adaptable to newly acquired information.

The fact that we don't know where it came from is the biggest indicator there are going to be lots of cases.

It'd have to have spread only to those people over the last 100 days.

Almost impossible."
"we're still testing hundreds of people daily though so it would eventually pick it up, you nonce."
Talk... like your uncles best friends neighbours missus said it?
"There might have been one or two asymptomatic, spreading or carrying it for ages.

Not an expert, but might be easily proven by looking into genome mutations."

The dead don't tend to feel anything.
"> Just read that NZ' has put 6.7% of children into poverty 

So way, way less than the US has with its failed containment..."
Has the U.S.'s child poverty rating gone up or down from 23% in 2017 to you reckon? I'd say we're more similar than you think. It's not like the virus hasn't damaged the U.S. economy.
"Yes, but how is that relative to everyone else? Is there some country that hasn't had children suffer to this pandemic?

It's nice quoting that statistic in a vacuum and claiming how bad it is, but what's relevant is how does that compare to other countries. It's not like the US magically lifted a bunch of children out of poverty during a pandemic."
And then it became 10k...
Some conspiracies have turned out to be legitimate. I wouldnt automatically discount something even if its been labeled a conspiracy. Just gotta watch your cognitive distortions
Govenant?
A conspiracy theory is a nice way to make yourself comfortable with complex information you don’t understand.
"Jeez this is the answer to most of the terrible info out there. What's more likely? That you don't understand epidemiology/virology? Or that the WHO, the CDC, hospitals, and scientists are lying."
I get ur point. Still it doesn't make sense is what I'm saying.
Their hospitals are also now not jam packed. Social media would have picked up if the government was lying.
"I would disagree. Pakistans law enforcement is not that capable to keep all the population Inside for an extended period of time. The initial 2 weeks the population cooperated but the last 2 weeks of lockdown people were relatively somewhat outside of homes.

 And after the lifting of lockdown, as cases started to increase, they kinda gave up because saving the economy was more important for the country, yet still after sometime the curve has been flattened meanwhile neighboring India with a similar weather and similar healthcare infrastructure  is constantly reporting more cases these days, unfortunately."
" I have doctor friends in Pakistan who are also saying that yes they are not seeing as much cases as they were 20 or 30 days back. A month before, those same people were telling me they are doomed"
"In cities, dining out in restaurants is common, so is going to Cinemas, shopping malls or other public places etc. Pakistani population was not happy with lockdown and it was never implemented properly. People were also not following any kind of social distancing etc and many would argue in Pakistan thats its a hoax or whatever. Not to mention pakistan couldn't keep mosques shut and people were regularly going there 4 or 5 times a day. (thats why a month back the number of cases was 3 times higher as of today). But now the curve has been flattened . Pakistan also is a pretty safe country, although u have to be vigilant about social norms like not drinking alcohol in public places. You View of the country does not match the reality."
Or...you know....first world countries test for it and play political theater over anything.
F you judith
My degree is theory based at the moment so while it sucked it was doable. I feel for those students who are supposed to be doing practicals across all forms of education
"New zealand has 4.69m people and 22 deaths total

USA has 330m people, ~70x more people. 166,763 deaths, ~7580x more.

If New Zealand had the population of the USA they'd have 1540 deaths.

There, now it's apples to apples."
"Iowa has a population of a little more than 3 million. New Zealand's population is a little over 4.5 million.

Iowa has had over 950 deaths, NZ is at 22.

New Zealand is clearly handling this well."
You’re actually dumb af if you think the per cap numbers aren’t also disturbing.
"Us 498 death per million, new zealend 5 deaths per million."
Half of NYC huh? So 11500 deaths vs. 22 deaths. Is it ok for you now?
"23k in NYC alone, vs 22 in New Zealand. Is that better?"
"Yes, thank you, everyone realises that. The per capita rate in the US is more than 100x higher and continues to grow exponentially while NZ is pretty much on lock.

You are obfuscating the conversation."
"Both are fruit. One has more vitamin C, the other is crunchier. Valid comparison.

NYC has approx 1000x the number of deaths NZ has (22 vs 24K)"
The real apple to orange comparison is that we have Ardern and the US has Trump.
Then why is trump using other countries opening school as an example that the U.S. can do the same if its apples to oranges? It's only apples to oranges when you talk about the sheer amount of excess deaths seen in the states?
"Honestly, I thought Ford and Kenney were going to fuck up huge. Instead Ford's done well, and Kenney....well he's been a fuck up since his mom decided to take the load instead of swallowing it."

The premier of Manitoba is Conservative.
"Same to you, hopefully we can vote the conservatives out soon"
"Since our first lockdown eliminated community spread of the virus, we have been free to move around. Under our alert level system we are locking down regions that have outbreaks, and travel was only allowed for essential medical or food supply workers.

So as of late last night, Aucklanders have to stay home, and there will be roadblocks to prevent people leaving the region. Outside of that city, people can move around a bit more."
"not said the virus is a hoax, a federal mandate to wear masks in public, and encouraging the shutdown of schools instead of encouraging the reopening of schools."
Absolutely everything. Have you been living under a rock for the past 8 months?
Ummmmm
"Without any ironically, 

literally everything."
You absolute fucking retarded bellend. Get fucked.
"Right. Like you can compare the US to New Zealand in any other category but all the sudden on COVID it’s a perfect comparison. 

No doubt they did great and the US has screwed the pooch. But they are entirely different animals. Look at a map for god sakes."
"All good :) 

I see people who had no intention of returning to nz, and even those who haven't been to nz in 30 years as they left as babies now returning to nz,

It's like umm, sure you have citezenshio but technically you aren't a kiwi, stop endangering those who are faithful to thier country"
"Very few countries have doubling rates of 3 days. That's the territory of uncontrolled outbreaks with no lockdown or serious suppression measures. In countries like New Zealand, Australia etc, the deaths to cases ratio is so close to the large scale epidemiology studies estimating an exact death rate that it's clear few cases are missed. There's a strong push for anyone with any sort of cold or flu like symptoms to get tested. One girl I work with has been tested 3 times, despite never being in the same city as an active unquarantined case."
"Why the fuck would you try to make jalapeno poppers? How about reasonable goals. Put some chicken in a hot pan. Put some veggies in the oven. If you want to be Gordon Ramsey you are going to need to put actual work into it.

Cooking is a life skill, and no one is expecting a culinary masterpiece."
"Even if everything you touch turns brown, there’s enough food you can get that’s microwavable. 

And if you can’t get that right... well maybe it’s time to see a doctor"
"I would not consider Jalapeno poppers a 'beginner level' project, starting simple and building up lattice of skills is important, and poppers where you have to balance spice levels and batter consistency and breading and frying is a pain in the ass. 

I'd suggest watching someone like J Kenji Lopez Alt and starting with the simple classic dishes like the 4 traditional roman pasta dishes, real simple shit that also teaches a lot of foundational knowledge. Dishes like [Cacio e Pepe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6QWoOQMvE8) are really simple follow-along tier stuff and taste amazing for the effort you put in."
This is me. I'm pretty sure I'd be able to burn water.
"I've read your other comments and kind of wish I could watch you cook to see what's going wrong. Try ready made pasta sauce, frozen vegetables, mushrooms, and pork mince. Chuck some onions in there and you're golden. (On pasta obvs)"
Public transport? Bike?  If you have a freezer many of the items can be frozen and many canned things don't need freezing. Cans of fruit and vege for example. Maybe this time if it's going to be a hassle you can get a delivery slot in advance?

"Under what law? Genuinely asking because I've been looking and I can't find anything that contradicts then NZBORA 1990

 NZ Bill of Rights Act 1990, s18(2)

(2)Every New Zealand citizen has the right to enter New Zealand


International Law mirrors this, further stating that if an alternative is available to refusing entry, it must be used first."
Oh really? Also I love your user name by the way lol
"Mhm, not sure. Checked the immigration website and says there are three reasons you would be allowed back into the country without first seeking approval: citizen, partner/children of citizen, and diplomats. Checking more about it."
Of course but we've been moving back to normal business as usual and it's still going to be the case that everyone is logging on at once. Have to prep
"Moving hardware takes time, even if software can be managed remotely."
Lots of people would've borrowed gear during lockdown and would need to pick it up tomorrow morning again. Not everyone has a home office ready to go.
Thank you! Purge alarm just woke me up at 6.55am so I guess I’m driving home a little earlier than expected hahaha 😂
Unfortunately no. I'm 20
I do. How do I leave?
"Yeah because the only other countries available to move to are 3rd world countries. Maybe travel a bit more and you’ll see as far as developed nations go, the US is becoming less desirable as time goes on."
"Healthcare, cost of living, ridiculous economic inequality, racial inequality, crime, work culture.

There are worse places to live but if you think the US is some kind bastion of freedom, I would suggest you take your own advice and visit some other countries.  I would leave the US for New Zealand in a heart beat if it wasn’t for my family."
"I enjoyed the simplicity and community with my time in Mexico. The only advantage I have here is I can buy mostly what I want. But ya can't really do that without giving up rent. What lottery my dude,I'm in Florida. Ah that's right it's America, where if I pull myself up hard enough I'll be CEO of the world. Unfortunately materialistic goals are not enough to bring me satisfaction and the classic ""other people have it worse therefore your criticisms are invalid"" are what's always done to not fix the core issue. Unfortunately experiences aren't universal and the suffering of one location does not cancel out the other."
"They already said there’s no connection between the family and international travel. Further to that though, the family apparently have no connection to any of the high risk staff either (ie staff working at any of the hotels, immigration staff, flight attendants etc), which is pretty much why we are going into lockdown."
"Nope, that was stopped after that whole two women who travelled from Auckland to Wellington 2 months ago. Since then no one has gotten dispensation.

Remember that family that jumped the fence (Mum and kids from Auz)? They were here for the kid’s father’s funeral, and they couldn’t get early leave, hence deciding to jump the fence."
"It's not that easy, it got really strict after the 2 ladies who traveled to welly for a funeral being let out early. People must have atleast 1 negative test before being allowed an excemption."
Accept what?

"Do you think that people's mental health would be better with COVID-19 everywhere? And there are alot of people out there that will die if they get this, I have Crohns disease and I'm on medication that suppresses my Immune system, I (like many others) am in what you call the ""high risk"" category, which means that I am very likely to die if I get this. 

You want evidence? Go look it up, there is all kinds of information out there from other countries, and no I don't have specialized knowledge, but the people that do have told me all about this while I was having one of my infusions at the hospital when all of this started, and I would much rather listen to them over ""JoshAllenforMessiah"" of reddit......"

"Wage subsidy was open to all businesses in NZ who had experienced or predicted a 30% decrease in revenue (compared to the same month last year) that was related to Covid-19. Businesses applying also had to retain employees that they named in their wage subsidy applications, doing their best to pay staff at least 80% of their usual wage. You can look up which businesses made use of the scheme here (e.g. The Warehouse, McDonald's, Mitre 10): https://services.workandincome.govt.nz/eps/search"
It’s provided to businesses that can show a 40% downturn (or 30% during the first lockdown) in revenue on the basis that they do not lay off staff they’re claiming the subsidy for.
"In the real world if you have connections with Government staff overseeing things you get more flexibility.

Our warehouse is fully operational even at level 4, not only that but they were working longer hours, many doing 12 hour shifts.

Fuck Capitalists, those scummy cunts aren't the ones risking their health or the health of their families. Fucking pieces of shit."
Yep. During L4 it was sales to essential services only for most suppliers.
That's basically what I said.
You... absolutely can. If Covid-19 means you can (temporarily) take away large swathes of people's right to freedom of movement you can certainly temporarily stop even citizens from coming back.

They have found no link to quarantine. Hense the emergency. It's not likely to be a worker
"If that's what you meant you should have been clearer than just a comment saying ""FFS Auckland"""
With second waves breaking out and especially what is happening in Melbourne they likely thought it a good idea to start giving us a bit more of a prod not to get to complacent. With information about masks being more widely accepted now and adopted world wide as a containment strategy it’s not unlikely they considered it a good idea to add to our prep list as well.
"My guy, its nearly impossible to tell when someone is being sarcastic over the internet. Especially when your in a thread where a bunch of people are being serious about the same thing your joking about. Bad timing."

So why isn’t Ireland the same? Why is Okinawa so much worse? What about Brooklyn? Don’t get so upset try to learn something.

"There were literally thousands of people being tested in that time.  These persons will have appeared to be just like every other shmo with a cold or the flu.

Rumours like that are inevitable in this environment.  

There is no logical reason for them to sit on this.  And contrary to what some people would have you believe, there is no nefarious government plot to sit on it.  

Ask yourself - what possible reason would they have to hide this?  The entire history of this disease shows that is not a viable strategy in any way."
"So what you're saying is that the issue is not Chinese people but national supporters and other smoothbrains.

I didn't know Jacinda was supposed to keep personal tabs on everyone who was in managed isolation! I'll bring it up the next time I see her.
"Nice someone with actual ideas and not just talking shit for the hell of it. Some really good points particulary 3 and 4. 

No exemptions regardless of the situation imo, if you're in quarantine then you stay in quarantine for the full 14 days no excuses.

I assumed there was rigorous testing for all people working closely with the returnees each week but that may not be the case especially with recent events at some of these facilities and the high number of kiwis returning home. There was bound to be a positive case to sneak through.

1 and 2 would be hard to enforce as people would bullshit their way back into the country especially kiwis who have lived outside of NZ for x amount of years and only want to come back to escape Covid. 

What about overseas based kiwis who have lost their job and who are genuinely struggling? Would they be allowed back in even though there is a high possibility that they will leave NZ once its safe to do so.

I dont mind if a kiwi leaves NZ to return to their country of residence then that should be ok as long as they not return back to NZ in the next 12 months or when its safe to do so."

"The rest of the world were the ones pointing at nz and saying 'see, that's how you do it'. Over here, we already knew to expect more cases. If you construe praise for bragging I don't know what to say.

Celebrations were had when we hit 0, and we're glad of the relative normalcy of life that we have been able to enjoy, but we're all under no illusions here."
"Because the US wasn't actually ""locked down"""
Do you want to be sad for a while or dead? A genuine question
"Yeah me too. The lockdown route is way better. Few weeks of level 2 or 3 here and there is much better than my immunocompromised wife dying. Sister and mum too. 

Sweden tried the ""just deal with it"" method, it completely fucked their economy. We did the lockdown thing and came out of it better than most other places, economy wise.

Some times the best way to help economies is to look after the people that make up that economy. Who would have thought."
"Death.. you'd rather choose death you dumbass. 

It has a 6% death rate in the states, if you got it once per year from the age of zero, all other health factors aside including age, you'd be dead before you're 21. 

There is no hard immunity, you're as moronic as the cunt who called us an authoritarian state, then said he'd rather have 150,000 people die."
I've never read an American newspaper in my life. I read that in a NZ site. There are many reports of repeat infection. There hasn't been time to do a clinical study as yet. So you want to risk your grandma? Mother? There is zero clinical evidence also that catching it gives sufficient antibodies to create immunity.. Nada. Zip. Nothing.

Based and true
"Because closure of public places stops those 4 cases turning into 40 cases, then 400 cases, etc. And with new Zealand being a civilised country, if these places get shut down, the citizens don't have to worry about going bankrupt due to lack of work or not being able to afford any medical treatment that stems from it"
"Not all Americans, just the vocal minority sadly."
"*Definitely* not all of us... broad brushstrokes make for a disingenuous picture. 

Like with most cases, people are people, all over the world... leaders, and the idiots who scream loud enough to be in the headlines and get viral vids made of their dumbassery, are not a valid picture of the majority of the population.

Ha! I did have a chuckle wondering if youd thought how it would sound. Its ok. You get a free pass this round. I think we're all allowed a mope/blub.
"Those 70 million children don’t stop learning after a year of not attending schools. Also, how does that affect the economy? 

Older people aren’t the only ones dying from the virus and it’s extremely selfish that you talk about other people’s lives like if you own them. You are nobody compared to the thousands that have died from the virus. 

I would prefer if somebody like you were to die instead of everybody else. Since you want people to die so bad, let’s put you up on the death sentence and start with you."
"Essential workers absolutely should be paid more in general and especially during the lockdown when they were put at risk.

But the government was trying to ease the burden of loss of income, if that doesn't apply to your employer it should be your employers job to give you extra money, not the governments."

"That analogy doesn't work on a fundamental level because cars actually serve a purpose in our society, the risk we take on using them is one we're aware of and consent to as a society.

I sure as shit don't consent to dying because some fucktard decided that ""Oh, only one in one hundred people will needlessly die from this preventable occurrence, it's fine""."
Good thing getting smoked by a car isn’t contagious
"If someone you cared about got ""smoked"" (which is a fucked word to use to describe the death of someone apparently close to you) by a *drunk* driver or a *speeding* driver or some other form of entitled fuckstain then you *absolutely would* be telling your friends not to drive impaired because you'd have to be a psychopath to not.

Well congratulations, you're not only the same kind of entitled fuckstain whose actions could easily kill people, you're taking to social media to encourage others to do the same."

"Mass hysteria? 150k people died in the United States alone, more than ww1 and Vietnam but we can prevent more deaths by just following what the scientists and doctors are saying"
Or in 50 years they'll talk about how difficult it was to get rid of because of people who think like you.
They will definitely be teaching about this period of time known as the stupid ages but not for the reasons you believe...
your willingness to brush off death in such numbers is astounding and only makes me hope you are a troll.
Ooo we have an epidemiologist here today everyone! Professional medical advice right here
"masks are proven to help. are there outliers? yes and this is a great example. your attacks on the ""mob mentality"" are embarrasing and intellectually dishonest"

"I *am* American. I'm not from New Zealand, though I can't deny I wish I was now a days."
"Um corona virus has already killed more people than influenza and it's only august. That's with country wide lockdowns and intense safety protocol. 

Nobody wants to shut down, they just don't want to risk lung damage or killing anyone they care about by bringing the disease home to them"
"Buddy that’s why we need to shut down for corona. We already have the flu. We don’t need another one, which is why we should prevent this."
Yeah could be a troll. Too many people that actually believe this though.
Complete idiot ✔️
Confirmed dickhead

"Ironically enough you’re right, regarding to the US of course."
Yeah exactly that too
"I mean there are people who still won’t wear a mask, don’t underestimate stupidity"
You dont got out much do you? People are absolutely that stupid.
Can't have a weakened economy when all the poor people die /s
Children are getting education: online schooling. It's way better than turning schools into makeshift prisons and magically expecting them to not contact each other to spread the virus. Schools are basically one massive petri dish on the hardest difficulty: it's impossible not to prevent spread.
Except the Mayo Clinic says the same.
"""especially you"" lmao what??"
Most of us can leave our homes and do whatever we want. I'm still traveling and had like 3 vacations this year. I spent most of the year in Europe and then traveled the US a bit.

"It was never meant to be a *prison*. Just like when we were all in Level 4, we weren’t locked in our homes."
There isn't  a perfect quarantine design.
"When excluding the year from the date, DD/MM makes more sense. Period."
"Yeah, that’s because you’ve been raised with it. The day comes first, then the month, then the year. That makes more sense because it goes in order from the smallest (a day) to the largest (a year) and the DAY is the most relevant."
"Waddup up, fellow ISO 8601 lover!"
I think the logic is smallest unit (day)/middle unit (month)/ biggest unit (year). Makes more sense to me than the month/day/year
"Programmers love YYYY-MM-DD with good reason, but I don't see it working in the real world. Most people would get fed up writing the same year over and over, so they would eventually just drop it like we do now. So over time, 2020-11-08 would become 11-08 and we're back to square one."

"Babe dont try using logic to sway people with low IQs, no matter how simple the logic is. They wont be able to follow it."
It's going to spread one way or another.  A lockdown was required but not as hard as what they initially pushed.  The goal should be to slow the virus not stop it

"Oof.

I want to go back to my normal life. Working from home is making me go crazy. If people only listened to health experts we might have a fighting chance of beating this thing."
"The patient was told it was a Democrat hoax, a Chinese hoax, a medical hoax, a Bill Gates-Tony Fauci-Satanic Demon hoax and those 'reasons' were all lies that killed Americans. That all came straight from Trump's mouth"
Fuck no its not. We're the best at being dumb dense motherfuckers.
"So you justify your shitty behavior by simply rejecting reality.

I understand."
"Live free? I think you mean, ""Be forced to return to work and potentially die so some billionaire can make some additional money.""

I'm missing the whole, ""Free"" part of this plan. I'm sure the millions of teachers who are being forced to return to school to catch the virus and potentially die as feeling so free right now.

Just drowning in that freedom to work and possibly die, or just die."
Being an island would not have stopped the community spread once it entered the country. What stopped the spread was test and trace combined with proper lockdown. Listening to scientists and enacting their recommendations.
No. It isn't.

I was going to say I hope its your family that gets COVID so you know what its really like. But being related to you is already more punishment than they deserve
"Authoritarian hides behind freedom indoctrination too. People secure in their rights and freedoms don't need to be out their ranting against masks and proclaiming ""AHH KNOW MAH RAAAGHTS!""

Freedom from medical bankruptcy and massive student debt is more free for many than owning an assault rifle and proclaiming themselves the freest. Meanwhile the US state is controlling what folks' life will be like for months, all the same. Just not delivering great quality. As are other such bastions of freedom, e.g. Bolsonaro."

"To be honest that’s pretty much undoable to the point that it would be a waste of effort. Lockdowns are gonna be a control at best, and vaccination is the main means of eradication. 

Without vaccination, country wide testing on a proper schedule and mandatory isolation of affected individuals would work too"
"So you agree then that New Zealand has been doing an excellent job handling the pandemic?

Hard lockdown long enough for the vast majority of the population to be able to go back to living completely normal lives.

And I say this from my glass house up here in Massachusetts where we are similarly doing really well, given that we're not an island nation with relatively controllable borders."
That’s... that’s not a good idea.
"Sweden has a bit over 10m people, 83k cases, and just under 6k deaths. The Czech Republic has a bit over 10.5m people, 18k cases, and less than 400 deaths.

Sweden has 566 deaths per million people. The US is at 498 per million. The US is not doing good, nor is Sweden."
"I don't speak Swedish, is that 5000+ dead?

In what bizzaro-land is that ""great""?"
Looks pretty shit.
5766 deaths vs NZ's 22
"So be it. We're a capable nation and we've survived without tourism before. If people weren't so obsessed with money, and more on keeping ourselves safe, a lot of this crap would be behind us. Unfortunately, for example, the USA put the cart before the horse, and instead of shutting down immediately, it became a little bit here and a little bit there and of course, the disgraceful situation of shutting down the pandemic response team that Obama government had put in place and of course, the orange fatty removed."
"There are a couple of vaccines showing good results in early trials, so it likely there will be mass roll outs of vaccines in Q1 of next year.

Sweden Q2 GDP figures are worse than neighbouring countries, and mortality rate is one of the worst in the world.

Given how soon vaccines are likely to be available, Sweden has in retrospect made a bad decision."
"Lol, dude anyone with a single brain cell knows that, it's never gonna just disappear. It's to limit it as much as we can until me vaccine is developed."
You poor guy...
160k deaths. Shut the fuck up
If everyone just took their medicine including America and locked down for 6weeks like good lil boys the world would of already been back to normal.
"Howd it work out?

Not trying to be a dick, but the only way to stop this is to shut down all international travel to you island And stop all imports. 

I bet good money that North korea has covid 19 in it. And they are locked down from forign shit way more then NZ"
"It doesnt delay, it makes the virus go to near zero level of impact. The virus dies off after certain time, with lockdown it will stop spreading uncontrollablx and mitigate the numbers. Healthcare then takes care of the ones infected, with the healthcare still functioning and not being overwhelmed

The moment active cases in country reach really low digits, the state can easily track and contain all possible infections

No delaying, lockdown really helps in suppressing the epidemic"

"I don't think you can have successful operation for over 3 months and then it turns out the quarantine is being mismanaged on such a scale that someone is at fault.

If it was being mismanaged, we would've had more problems. Even the army would have cases of human error that would lead to transmission. It's an impossible beast to keep out."
oh interesting. I think the WHO was saying there had only been very few incidences of it that they know about. wonder if this is a theory vs practise thing.
"Yes, but it isn't a known link, which means they likely wouldn't have got it directly from someone who works on the front line. If they got a positive test and knew someone who worked on the front-line, it would be more simple to trace the contact. 

It seems more plausible to me that they're further down a chain of transmission, making it unclear where to trace it back to. They got it from someone, who got it form someone, who got it from a person at the border, who got it from someone coming in from overseas. Something more like that, ya know?"
"No link to international travel doesn't just mean they haven't traveled, it also means they've traced their contacts and found that they haven't directly interacted with anyone who has been overseas. 

I'm not saying it magically appeared, I'm saying it looks like they're not the 2nd link in a chain of transmission. They're further along, which makes contact tracing difficult.

My first inclination would also be that staff at the border hotels, somewhere, contracted it and then spread it somewhere else, which inevitably led to this family."
"Yeah, but back then nobody in France knew what covid-19 was and nobody got tested.

So it makes sense that it remained undetected for so long, unlike now."

Yeah fair enough mate
"Proportionally our country is suffering much greater, per capita, than many others. Higher infection rate, higher death rate, and also our fake ass paper tiger economy got obliterated

I’ll tell you exactly why that is. It’s because Donald Trump:

1.	Diminished our ability to react to a pandemic by cutting our CDC team in China, did not refill our emergency medical stockpiles when warned to, and dismissed the virus as a “democrat hoax”
2.	Actively tries to slow down testing because high infection rates “make him look bad”
3.	Pushes conspiracies he learned from Xi Jinping, such as “the virus will go away in the summer heat”, fires and slanders doctors and scientists who tell the truth
4.	Refused quarantine measures until it was too late because he was afraid of it hurting his fake economy
5.	One day after announcing lockdowns and seeing the stock market tank, he begins telling Americans they need to reopen their cities
6.	Told states that getting medical supplies is “not my problem”
7.	Actively encourages Americans to not wear a mask

I have a source for everything I just said, and I’ll be happy to produce them if you wish :)"

"We're just happy our leaders did the right thing regardless of who happened to be in charge at the time. As my previous comment implied, other people are bringing their own baggage into the conversation. It looks like you need a porter."
">he fact that  NZ has been held up as this utopia where a ""democratic-socialist did everything right US BAD NZ GOOD!!"" has made people with half brain realize that there is a wacko political agenda being pushed hard.

I can promise you right now that a shitload of those comments did not come from NZ. Reddit jerks off this country like they're paid to do it, it's absolute insanity because they ignore literally any flaws with the country. They're the world's best marketing department."
"Oh I'm all for letting them come here, for a price. We're not *ideally* for sale, but if we are then milk it because it's not like they're using the money anyway.

Bezos and Co want to hide here from the plague? 

Sweet, that'll be 5% of your net worth, flat fee. 

No?

Good luck out there, call us when you reconsider."
If you think it's just the northeast than I have a bridge to sell you. I mean dense populations are going to be hit harder than other places. Right? That doesn't seem to be a factor at all in your thought process.
I'm an American. I live in Florida.
"It isn't absurd, just look at Vietnam! Almost the exact amount of time for the cases to finally be detected as well. I suggest you have a read of David Speiglehalter's book ""the art of statistics"" to understand such matters a bit more. If you're not testing enough you won't find something. Singapore has roughly the same population as NZ and tests >20k per day. NZ has been testing less than 25% that number."
My milk is down to the dregs and I was gonna get more today but couldn't be bothered. Little did I know!
Why haven't they consulted with Random Guy on Reddit already? He knows more than the actual experts.
A joke that gave us  months of economic normality compared to the rest of the world.
"I'm aware. That's what I mean. With no community transmission many people seemed to decide that keeping their illnesses to themselves was no longer important. Happy to spread around whatever cold or virus they've got, go to work, etc. I really can't understand why people think it's OK to spread illness if it's not covid (without knowing for certain if it is or isn't, despite the slim chance)."
Oh good. I wish my government was on top of things.
"Yeah, I guess we'll know more around midday after their formal meeting

I should add I'm going to my lecture via zoom broadcast because screw it, don't wanna risk running around campus rn until things settle down"
"Emails say that nothing much is changing. Large gatherings are to be postponed, and people are to social distance where possible"
"Some of lecture halls have social distancing stickers, some lectures have a zoom broadcast, but yeah it's obviously less than ideal even with the attendance dropoff over the tri/semester"
Lots of the academics in the faculty were frittering about the lack of face to face teaching time and the death of education. But I bet uni management is pretty happy with their decision right about now!
Even through Auckland? He didn’t seem to think so
Mmmmm food info.
"On the telly, they did say that they are on standby with level 4. 

It’s my guess that we will be put in level 4 if things haven’t calmed down in the three days"
You can't trace what hasn't existed till now... This has nothing to do with our tracing ability.
"My online media usage has skyrocketed since covid hit (coupled with trumps fuck ups). I really wish i took my own advice not to do this but I have. It’s a colossal waste of time and just contributes to depression.  It’s a sick addiction

Edit: It’s a bit like continually checking the pantry for bits of food you might have missed earlier. Except this is even worse I reckon"
"Yup, it's very depressing. 

What genuinely baffles me (if you check our r/Conservative or like-minded people) is that they *CONSTANTLY* says things like ""we're ruining our country over a virus that kills 0.4% of the population"" or something like that. I assume they're probably just repeating things that conservative politicians and conservative commentators say. 

I have to wonder what level of death *is* concerning."
Yes. Sorry you're in it so deep.
"Yeah and I live in LA, county size is 10mil and amazingly we’ve administered nearly 2mil tests, so I guess that’s good news. Probably the best testing in the country at the moment, and fortunately it looks like we’re past the plateau. Should we open back up yet? Definitely not. Hospitals are still in danger of hitting capacity if there’s another uptick http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf"
Oh damn I got wooshed
"Well, they got there first, didn't they? I was just refuting the fact that the USA did it all alone, without France, Britain, resistance all over the continent, and Russia."
"Probably, my work mate was also told the same thing at another place. Wonder how many others ran into the same thing."
"It was after the auckland->wellington covid sisters went on their road trip and people panicked and unexpectedly overwhelmed testing facilities, so they tried to slow that down. Which has now had a misinformation knock on effect."
This makes me so mad
Why refuse a test? Do they give a reason? :-D
"Both my siblings have 3 kids each, them and their partners have both have jobs. So that's 10 people going to 4 different jobs, 2 different schools and two different kindys. In the past few weeks all of them have said they have had winter ""colds"" and it is there right to not accept tests."
So what are you implying in your original comment then?
"I think he’s more of a cancer, as the nastiness has metastasised from Fox’s America and is spreading like a bed of weeds."
So act like you have covid and get it tested.
Same :( Test time
"Like getting fizzy drink up your nose, so uncomfortable but not painful"
It doesn’t hurt as bad as it would finding out you had it and you were spreading it around to everyone you know and love.
"Yo, here’s a hot tip.... the warehouse and Kmart sell the best sweat pants. The lining is so soft and doesn’t turn to shit in the wash. 

I don’t really mind the hallenstines sweat pants but they are like twice the money for the same style and comfort level as Kmart and the warehouse. 

I’ve also dabbled in like super expensive sweatpants and let me tell you this, they were my worst purchases of 2019. I still think about the wasted money. 

I’ve always said if you can sleep comfortably in sweat pants you’ll have zero problems wearing them during the day. 

Pro tip: you will never go wrong with a comfortable over sized hoody"
I love your rant. It's true and it's perfect.
Yup that's the one.
Abe never had the ball.   There is no ball anymore.  A couple of governors are trying to fashion a ball out fax papers hackysack like.
It wasn't really anything you needed to wake up for and take action against right at that moment though. And they already blasted our phones with the exact same message last night.
And it's also exactly the same message that we got at 10pm last night? Everyone already knew. It was nothing new or important
"Because of level 2, really?"
Why is amber alert being used in this situation? The entire point of an Amber alert is to find a missing child. It was literally named after a child named Amber.
"Imagine thinking 7.5 billion people all need exactly 8 hours. (also just because you go to bed at 11 and wake at 7 doesn't mean you actually slept for 8 hours. Crazy right)

"Every person is different. Teenagers seem to need 9+, older folks can be fine with 6. 

It also depends on other factors - if you've been exercizing, drinking, out in nature, etc, your body goes pretty tired.

And who the fuck goes to bed at 11pm? What are you, like 60?"
I have a pretty good job tbh but I havent gone to bed before midnight in years. I guess having kids might change that? I think I would end up just lying there
"No, the rest of the country is going into level 2."
He was saying the rest of the country excluding Auckland... Rest of country is level 2 for same period but I wouldn't be surprised if they extend it longer.
Only Auckland is Level 3.
"From noon, Wednesday the 12th of August, the country *excluding auckland* is at level 2.

Auckland will be at level 3."
"I guess I was responding to ""we'll get it under control"". That's looking pretty optimistic. I hope you're right."

Over half the traffic is international but if you ignore the foreign stuff then it's only American? What sort of crazy logic is that?!
"That would be dumb. If it's out we need to lock down asap to figure out who, where and how while stopping spread. Sitting on that information is the worst action to take and should lead to greater panic not less."
"Keep it up buddy, I'm sure one day your parents will say they're proud of you"
"Sweden designed their measures based around voluntary social distancing and banning gatherings of 50 or more people. The problem with translating that to America is that while Swedes voluntarily listened to healthcare professionals and have about 30% of the social interaction they used to, the average American is too busy being selfish and ignorant to even think of other people around them. So yes, Sweden has been improving drastically. However, that strategy is not going to work in America."
"I tried to look it up, but dont quote me on this, the Q2 of NZ is projected to have a drop between 10%-20% it seems."
"I knew a lot of people from US.  They were people I consider friends and I hope they are all well. It is because of them I try not to generalize country’s population, it’s never a good thing to do, but if I am perfectly honest - it is harder and harder not to do that with each passing week. Especially if you just switch on the news. 

I mean, the man elected to represent your country tried to buy Greenland from us, and then threw a temper tantrum when nobody took him seriously? And with everything that has transpired, that seems like peanuts right now."
"Sorry to hear it. It really is BS - construction here is like Dune - ‘The construction must flow’. So every day They work on the Carlton towers for international students who just aren’t coming back. Is the long tail of the big bet on international students, and it’s gonna sting soon enough."
Probably depends how enthusiastic your doctor is... kind of like a smear...
"> Maybe for people who get their news in the paper or at 6pm.

The people who don't wear masks or say it doesn't help I just tell them to tell their surgeon not to wear a mask or gloves the next time they go into surgery. That usually makes them think.
And MY head fuckface decided it would be smart to have mask exemption cards as an online print off for anyone who wants one. Cheers Boris
the fuckface in charge of the US was offered by 3M to make millions of masks back in January. He declined.
You don't even really need N95. Leave that supply for medical scenarios. Even basic cloth masks massively reduce transmission with enough adoption.

Or told us were to get them from. all stores that sold them should have them at the front of the store and they should have signs saying MASKS SOLD HERE. My parents and I haven't noticed them being available during these past few months.
O got it. Thanks for clarifying.
And that means what?
"1) 155,000 *counted* deaths in America is not a small number, it's more than in all American wars since the Second World War, and more than in the First World War, but I guess you're tired of hearing that statistic and it's meaningless to you now. Adjusted for population that would be around 2000 deaths. Sounds small to you? Sure. 22 sounds better.

2) New Zealand is a very obese nation. We also have high child obesity rates. Does your *think of the children* act take into account the fact that children can have comorbidities to COVID hospitalisation through no fault of their own? I also don't think obese adults dying *en masse* would have such a limited impact on the lives of the country's children, several of whom would be left orphans, to be offset by a month and a few days' more school.

3) Obese people don't deserve to die. Nor do smokers. If they did, such people account for enough of our workforce and consumer base that it would impact the economy, if that's the only metric we're going by.

4) Most of the people hospitalised in America may be fat, in fact it would be difficult for them not to be with [an adult obesity rate of over 40%](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html). This is not intended as an insult. It is a public health statistic. Even if I were to take your word about ""most of the people"" that are hospitalised in America being overweight, how is that a reassurance for a country with not-incomparable obesity stats?

5) Even if you don't give a fuck about adults and children who 'got fat', would you extend that same callousness to people with the audacity to [get old?](https://nypost.com/2020/06/27/almost-half-of-us-covid-19-deaths-are-linked-to-nursing-homes/) This one is from the US. Yeah, I guess many of them are overweight. That happens when you get old.

I don't want mass death in my country, and neither do it's children."
"If your phone is new enough you should of got it. Not that it was a nice thing to get at 10pm with headphones on watching YouTube. Scared the shit out if me having the alert in my ears. :P

Got it on spark, didnt get it on vodafone (neither message)"
"That's your phone then unfortunately. Google how to check you've enabled emergency notifications, usually called presidental alerts or some such."
Of course!
"Sadly, many of us are all going to be taught a hard lesson wether COVID instigates that or not. 

People fail to realize that thoughts and actions like this mother's will have dire consequences to people actually trying.  

We're all on a sinking ship wether we want to be or not."
"You okay snowflake? Wtf is a full throated defense? I admitted that America obviously has its problems but that Americans who are shitting on their own country are fucking lame, unwad your panties.

So many countries are so much worse off but people wanna join in on the America sucks train cause it’s popular right now."

"1% of people still die from it, can you imagine a scenario where there is secret underground spread happening and less than 100 people have been infected in 100 days? Really? Think a few would end up sick huh"
"Given there hasn’t been a lockdown in NZ recently, you’d expect an exponential increase in true case numbers (not just reported) if there is actual community transmission. No one’s been showing up in hospital, and testing is still ongoing (despite in low numbers). I believe the comment I replied to was implying that NZ has had ‘silent’ community transmission the whole time. That won’t be the case, though at this point it’s not certain who patient 0 is and when they became infective."
"Ah yes, compared to the US, yes, but this isn't a nation-wide lockdown by any means."

Agreed. It's a bit easier to go back into lockdown when we've had two months of genuine normality to get our stress levels down first.
Yes. I have a DND setting that kicks on at 10pm and ends at 7am.
"Even at ten percent, that is one in ten. 1 percent, one in a hundred. The fact remains, if there are no hospitalisations yet, it is hopefully not yet widespread and they should have a shot at containing it."
It makes it a hell of a lot less bumpy. It's the difference between putting the economy on pause (and paying with taxpayer money) and crashing it into a brick wall (and letting taxpayers pay for their own problems).
"Yea nah I’m with you, ive seen him naked and ugh. Just no"
"You want to know what's actually dick head behaviour?

I’m sorry!! 😭😭😭
">Level 3 is level 4 with maccas.

And a whole tonne of trade jobs that can be done socially distanced and can't be done from home.  Tens of thousands more people can work in level 3 that can't at 4"
This is what I'm thinking - either 2 weeks to start of level 3 or 4. Start slow to avoid a panic (not working apparently).
Darn. I hope you’re wrong :(

Looks like I'm extra dumb since everyone pointed out that they're op. Thanks for the info!
Agreed
"""our own subreddit"""
"It's certainly possible.  There's little value in predicting when we really don't have any way to know.  Agree that the further the source is from where it's discovered there is greatly-increased potential for it to have spread widely.

We don't want people to under-estimate this....but there's also risk to people's mental health to make them think there will be hundreds if not thousands and we're about to jump into another multi-week lockdown.  Neither scenario is good - but we'll manage no matter what happens."
It's alarming to me that people needed clarification on your comment. Where has reading comprehension gone?
"Brave, but foolish my old jedi friend"
"The US has more toilets than NZ too.  Is that the cause of our failed response?  You have to explain why the comparison is actually meaningful for your comment to mean anything.  

How has the population difference caused issues?  Is that why our federal leadership was a disaster?  Too many people for the President to form a coherent thought on how to address COVID?  Too many people for his administration to form an effective plan (much less any plan at all)?

We have a lot more resources to go with our larger population.  Unless you can show how we had an effective plan but it failed due to our size, your comparison doesn't mean anything."
Apparently no!?  No need to be rude.
Iirc International law means that you aren't legally allowed to prevent your citizens from returning to your country
We aren't legally allowed to prevent NZ citizens from returning to NZ.
Excuse me but why weren't they treated as part of the quarantine process?
"Wait

We hadn't?

Excuse me what?"
"> The most likely scenario, experts say, is that the pandemic ends at some point—because enough people have been either infected or vaccinated"
TF does that have to do with anything?  NZ offering their children as ritual sacrifice to the Covid gods has no relationship to America's shitty situation.
"Still favoring those numbers fam... and its a bit of a stretch to say 10k from one family after ya'll lock it down. You want real fear come over to the US, no need to make it up saying 10k cases from 4...."
"Correct! And they are also neverending rabbit holes with some shadowy faceless enemy at the end. And if you disprove that, they move the goalposts further down the hole. Shit’s infuriating."
"Oh for sure! And I apologize if I came across as derogatory, the use of the word “conspiracy” nettles me a bit.  But this is a great opportunity to do more research  about virology and Covid in general, follow the news on NZ and see if you can separate the facts from the fantasy.  Just make sure you evaluate your news sources critically and without bias.  It’s a skill we all need to develop these days."
"To you, not in general. Like he said, just because you don't understand doesn't mean its nefarious."
You clearly don’t get their point. Just because it doesn’t make sense to you doesn’t make it a government plot.
You’re right... social media is the gold standard of reality and truth.
"A nationwide lockdown for four weeks that wasn't enforced as effectively as maybe it could have been is not fairly characterized as ""no strict lockdown restrictions."" 
 Pakistan temporarily stopped the spread of COVID with a rapid, aggressive lockdown response, same as every other place that successfully did it.  Their rate is also still quite high, relatively speaking.  They stopped the exponential explosion in cases at the beginning of the pandemic very effectively but I wouldn't say they are faring particularly well."
Yup just imagine if our (US) government took the same action as NZ.
"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
Because Trump is an idiot and doesn't understand that the response in the US is vastly different from other countries.
Adding to this: encouraging people to trust health officials
Remember he encouraged the opening of schools while pardoning a criminal for fear of COVID-19
"Yep, the POTUS should have unified the country to rally behind a clear and overall objective of sheltering in place and reduce the cases regardless of states political affiliation. We are a global economy and global society now and a short term financial recession is easier to bounce back from verses a long term depression. Just to think if the mindset was changed and we all were on the same page we would be back to some semblance of normalcy right now."
"I’ll absolutely give you the first and third, but the federal government lacks any authority to do the second."
"You don't really know anything about how the US federal government works, do you?"
"That’s not an answer. 

I just don’t believe the president has the power to effect the change you want, both legally and socially. Take masks for example, he’s already said “wear masks,” yet the people who choose not to still forego it."
"On COVID it is a similar comparison. We aren’t talking about anything else. They are different but that does not mean the US could’ve taken similar steps to prevent the spread of infection. In the end it was the inaction/action which spread the disease so that is what we are talking about. New Zealand listened to their scientific community and took the appropriate actions relating to their population, location, etc and it worked."
Exactly!!!
"Mmm the ones I make are too easy to mess up. jalapenos, sliced in half, seeds scooped out and rinsed with cold water if spicy is a problem. 
Mix room temp or slightly microwaved cream cheese and shredded cheese together.
Scoop and spread cream cheese mix into halved jalapenos 
Wrap in bacon.
Put on baking sheet and cook at 350 for 20-25 mins. 

But if he tried deep frying and breading ... Too advanced."
"Maybe we have a different idea of poppers, I just cut the jalapeños in half, scooped out the inside, filled it with a cream cheese/shredded cheese mix and then breaded it. I also used a spray bottle with olive oil in it to coat them lightly and then baked them at 425 for like 15 mins until the filling started to leak slightly.

They made me extremely sick to my stomach unfortunately, but I still managed to eat 4 or 5 before putting the rest in the fridge for tonight's dinner."

Why not just deport infected people while you're at it?
"If they’re coming here from overseas they’re a huge risk 

You can’t block citizens without making people stateless, but “these people” have a state to live in, they should stay put. I’m not going to drive from Auckland to Dunedin tomorrow just because I have some connections down there, it’s selfish and irresponsible."

"Perhaps I misheard, but I believe Bloomfield said that new case 1 had a positive swab yesterday (but had had symptoms for about 5 days). Which I guess wouldn't necessarily contradict your statement, if they were being tested repeatedly....

Edit: there's nothing in your post history (or comment history) mentioning this within the last 5 days or so."
By our 4th or 5th lockdown the people will not do it any more.

"No they don’t, but my community does. The issue isn’t chinese people (I am one myself), the issue is how utterly little information and selective information at that, MY chinese community is getting and reacting to. They’re forming an echo chamber in wechat. I’m not saying they’re pro CCP, but the education in China (I received one) is built to eliminate critical thinking and only follow the “right” answer and unable to see anything else once they make up their mind. So just like “All hail Xi”, they can see no wrong in national (somehow they’ve decided National is the party they will follow), and everything labour does or happens during labour’s term is labour’s fault and only labour’s fault."

"Online schooling doesn't work for children. You're making lives worse for poor children. Most poor children in the US don't even have internet. 

They thank you for destroying their lives."
"Yes, Especially some random on the internet who spouts about no evidence of immunity - which is absolutely impossible to make a conclusion on, since its way too early to tell. There hasn’t been anyone who  has caught it twice, but the only way we can tell whether there is immunity is to wait 15 years (or, really, 50 years) and see if anyone does catch it again.  

The comment is claiming to be correct because a negative hasn’t been proven (a logical impossibility), 

So to make such a definitive statement is just bollocks. The commentator has no idea."
"Can, doesn’t mean you should."
"The stock market is going well which is all that matters. Unemployed people are making sacrifices to preserve companies, Americans care about things bigger than themselves. And our freedom is preserved, only liberal cities have coronavirus anyways"
Yes there is. No planes. Borders closed.

"I believe the US is the odd one out here. The MM/DD format was used very occasionally by the British empire, but they along with the rest of the world adopted DD/MM. The US didn’t.

"He is American, I wouldn't put it past him."
"That is exactly what I hear all of the time. I just want people to see that this entire thing is multi-factorial. If your family situation requires you to need your children in-school classes (maybe because you need to work), that doesnt make you a teacher-killing-child-hater. 

If you are losing a business or unemployed, that doesnt mean that you are a trump-supporting-covidiot who puts the economy over human life. 

Its just getting crazy out there, and ALL of these nuances are important. I worry that if lockdowns get stricter & go on much longer, then we risk losing ALL of the things that we have worked this long to protect. 

I have heard that several countries are rolling out their vaccine trials, so that could be promising at least."

"New Zealand has a population of around 4.8 million. New York City has a population around 18 Million. NYC has a bout 60 million visitors a year...NZ about 3.8 million per year. NYC was the first epicenter in the US.

Gov. Coumo of NY threatened to sue other states if they banned travelers from NY.

So ya being an Island country with 1/4th the population of Ney York City and having a fairly low number of travelers absolutely helped in not having a major outbreak."
Keep collecting toy cars my man hope you find happiness
Authoritarian policies have caused over 100 million deaths in the 20st century alone my man. The fact that in this situation authoritarian policies might work better (which is also highly debatable tbh) does not mean that an authoritarian government is good. Nothing good can come from giving them so much power.
Im not from the usa man for the millionth time. The country where i am from has a higher personal freedom than your country according to your human index list. For a second stop thinking in a hive mind please
Better fucked in the head than fucked by the government. But to each their own. Good day mate

"What the plan is and is for every other disease is to keep infection rates down so the hospitals don’t get over crowded whilst trying to not effect the economy at a high degree, that is what Sweden has done. Compared to NZ by looking at statistics the disease barely existed in the first place so one could discuss the effect of the flattening if the curve. 5k deaths is not much, in Sweden roughly 80k die yearly and the Corona deaths don’t deter much from the normal mortality over that period. Our hospitals have managed the disease fine and we did not have to use our temporary field hospitals either, which have now been dismounted. To this date i don’t know anyone who gave gotten the disease and I work with people.

(All these reply’s and I can only reply every 10 mins is a bit annoying lol)"
New cases can easily be traced and contained yet New Zealand is using the military to enforce an entire new lockdown. This won't be the last lockdown either.

It worked back in March for the original lockdown.
Ok I just got it now. Maybe I am worthy after all. Just not as worthy as the rest of you.
Maybe your reception isn't good enough? Noone in my house got it until we headed to the other side of the house where there's better reception
Well I had an alert previously when we were going into lockdown back in March. But not now for whatever reason.
"Oof, don't you love how Florida has to maintain our rep durring the pandemic. It's great, the legends about Florida man are totally worth 10k cases a day. And it's not like our schools reopen next week or anything dumb like that /s."

"Yes, 4.5 million people. And 24 deaths. The U.S. has had 163,000 out of our 330 million people die. Extrapolating for population, New Zealand would have ~1,600 deaths, meaning they are currently under 1% of the death rate of the U.S.

Thank you for making my point for me.  Economic instability is guaranteed during a pandemic. A death rate like the U.S. does not have to be. New Zealand is clearly an example of doing things right."
"If NZ catches all the infected people in a week and quarantines them, they can reopen completely relatively soon. Whereas the US is in a constant state of not being completely open. Which makes the US situation worse than the situation in NZ.

"If you are sick and don't get tested you are exposing those people anyway. This is no excuse. The priority should be ""I don't want to spread COVID-19"" not ""I don't want people to have to get tested"""
Stay on hold and watch some Netflix while you wait.
Did you get through?
"WHO does not speculate and only refers to known data. This has lead to a lot of misinformation, sadly. For example, when they were asked about mask usage, they did not recommend masks at first because no data was available. This can be misinterpreted as “don’t use masks” instead of “we don’t know yet”."
Yeah that's my point haha. It could've been passed on at paknsave on the way home from work.

Mexico: 10.9%

I have this same argument with so called “patriots”. They always throw “I love America” in the conversation to justify their opinions or that you hate America because you don’t agree with their opinions. Last I checked personal opinions are not grounds for being a traitor.
Eh?  Wassat?
"I don't understand why they'd hate so many of us. I can totally understand hate for our government, but I myself am not a government official, nor am I one of those people screaming about wearing masks. In fact I'm probably not much different from you anon. What logical reason could there be to just hate me instantly without even knowing me?"
"Doesnt matter who was in the seat.   A major superpower, surrounded on both borders even with essential import and export we were STILL going to get this.    There is no politics in saying no one can stop or eradicate this.   We need a vaccine, sanitation measures, and to keep immunocompromised people safe.  You are silly if you think it mattered who was driving the bus during a pandemic.  Just look at the fragility of 100 days without a case and now what will the narrative be?  Only 4 cases!!!!   Someone lied!!!!   Mask up!!  New Normal!!!!   Almost is good enough!!"
Exactly.
"Yes it is absurd, 100 days of community transmission that has only just now been picked up on is madness. This having some link to the border/ isolation facilities is the far more sane answer."
I guess it would be a bit easier to contact trace a lecture rather than another large gathering in a public-ish place.
They must be lol
"Yes, people can still travel to return to their place of residence, or for essential work, or transit. AirNZ could change flights if they’re low, but technically he should be able to travel. They’ll be more info tomorrow anyway"
Yeah I think you’re right
"You can test asymptomatic people. And build that into your tracing system.
Hence why the system isn’t adequate 

Or you can put your head in the sand and repeat the phrase ‘no evidence of community spread’"
Me too; I could have read War and Peace like 5 times by now.
Happens to the best of us mate.
"There was a lot of flipflopping when reagent supplies and limited laboratory time restricted testing. So probably quite a few people, iirc there was a guy in rotorua who made the newspapers because he had to wait so long"
"Infuriating, sure it’ll likely come back negative but the only way to know about community transmission is by doing surveillance testing on everyone who is symptomatic. Really grinds my gears that people aren’t being team players."
They don’t want it to hurt/don’t want to isolate/can’t be bothered
Exactly what I said?
I am in Auckland
"Wait, which ones did you buy from Kmart and The Warehouse? I've only ever gotten shit ones from there which is why I switched to my flash as $50 Hallensteins ones. I had a pair of sweatpants from The Warehouse that I bought in Level 4 that died a horrible linty death the first time I put it in a cold gentle wash, F.

I am currently wearing a great oversized hoody though 😁 turns out Jeanswest do great quality thin ones that are like 2 for $50. Perfect for all weather, I sleep in them too."

I'm really miserable here.  

Not every one can be so lucky to live in a country famous for a mass shooting and being second only to Antartica in combating corona efficacy.  Some of us just have to settle living in a lowly super power nation like America."

"America's inability to recognize the threat of the virus, or to recognize but dismiss the threat of the virus is newsworthy.  That the wealthiest country in the world can't buy or bully its way out of something like this is making front page news all over the world.  As someone else pointed out, this is an American owned site used primarily by Americans.  When something this newsworthy makes the front page you can't expect people, regardless of nationality, to not look at it in comparison to their own situation.  It's a fucking pandemic.  It's about the whole world.  For you to try to gatekeep a global crisis proves how pervasive America's culture is.  You're fucking acting just like one."

"1) The US had 400,000 deaths in World War II. You're spreading lies. Even so it's a pandemic. We have more sick people than other countries. People think differently here. I'm sorry that bothers you.

2) Most children aren't being hospitalized. This is fear mongering.

3) They do not deserve to die but they should be allowed to shutdown society. This is not a right.

4) Obese people are sick people. It's an illness just like diabetes and heart disease. You can compare obesity stats if you want. 

""Approximately 90% of hospitalized patients identified through COVID-NET had one or more underlying conditions, the most common being obesity, hypertension, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.""

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm

5) We need to protect the old but that doesn't mean the rest of the population should be locked down.


Yeah, um, so Covid doesn't really effect children. This is bore out in the statistics. What does effect children is not getting an adequate education and having less opportunities in life. Imagine giving up your entire life because someone decided it was okay to get fat and sick."
I just got it now. 655am. Scared the shit out of me.

"I did not say I wish I lived somewhere else. I wish I lived in a country that cared about its citizens, which the US can be. It's just not, not with our current leadership. I guess better phrasing would be I wish the US cared about its citizens over short term economic indicators."
I’m giving reasons for why people can’t just leave their area when there is a coronavirus pandemic going on. You’re the loser who is making assumptions and assuming everyone wants to backpack their way out of America. Many people who live in cities that are coronavirus hotspots in the US wish they could leave to more secluded parts of the USA but they simply don’t have the money.
"Right. The US needs to do a better job regardless of size, but circumstances are that it would be impossible for the US to do what New Zealand did where they almost eradicated the virus. Culture also has a big part to do with it and a huge distrust in the government is what has caused people to push back"

They get a test every two weeks. A recent report highlighted this as a weak link
"Exactly. And now the decision is whether rolling lockdowns and the negative impacts from them are worth it. 

One extreme opinion is that no lockdown is worth it even if the vaccine is months away.

The other extreme is that lockdowns are worth it even if vaccine is decades away.

I’m closer to the former, you’re closer to the latter, but you and I are probably closer to each other than to our respective extremes. 

Also, we both agree that Spectrum sucks. So cheers to that at least."
"I'm saying that you point out that child poverty has increased here. I don't think it's decreased anywhere in the world during this pandemic. Are you really sure enough of your country's statistics that you are comfortable to use ours to tell us we're doing the wrong thing or as you out it, insane?

Side note: I've made that exact same analogy of ""sacrifice to the covid gods"".  Not kidding or lying. I've honestly said that. But I was making it in reference to people who have literally died to keep the economy going strong."
"The family hadn't traveled abroad. That means there are more than four cases. Where did they come from? It's likely the virus is spreading among asymptomatic people. Remember, the US has much more illness than the NZ. In NZ it will be much easier for it to spread without people knowing.

If you don't have any symptoms why would you think to get tested? The testing is already at very low levels in NZ, right? And pretty soon you have 100k cases."
"Yup we all celebrated New Zealand's Victory against covid and we questioned our governments handling of the pandemic so it breaks my heart to know its once again back in New Zealand. However, I'm hopeful they'll get it under control once again ."
Electronic and print media is controlled to some extent in Pakistan by the state but on social media anyone can visit a hospital and make a video of full covid wards and ICUs or piles of bodies.

How long did he wait to say that because by my count it was at least 6 months after he should have. He should have set the tone right off the bat by wearing one himself and imploring his supporters to wear them too. Additional things he could have done differently:

* Not disband the WH pandemic task force
* Not spent the first 2 months calling Covid-19 a Democratic hoax
* Not holding campaign rallies in the middle of a pandemic
* Spend significantly less time golfing and more time dealing with the pandemic in the early stages
* Not publicly undermine the CDC, HHS, and Fauci at almost every step of the way
* Utilized the ~70 page pandemic playbook left for him instead of ignoring it
* Spent the first three months while it was raging outside of the US stockpiling ventilators, PPE, etc.
* Not antagonize states' governors to get them to prematurely open, which is why we're in the midst of a large spike in the first wave
* Not egg on anti-masking covidiots to go out and ""protest"" masks with firearms at state capitol buildings in order to ""liberate"" themselves

The list goes on and on, so I ask again: have you been living under a rock for the past 8 months?"

Of course not but here’s what a lot of us don’t seem to understand.  We don’t have some kind of claim to “freedom”.  The freedom we enjoy can be found all around the world.

Humans can infect cats and this past week seen confirmation that dogs can also be infected. This has been researched by testing infected people's pets and by testing zoo animals as they have been researching potential reservoirs where the disease might hide.

"This is a New Zealand sub though, and this lockdown is a New Zealand issue, not a USA one. We've aimed and mostly succeeded in giving our kids the necessary technology (aka laptops) to stay connected and learn, with thousands of laptops being rented/given to those in need of such. If they don't have access to that, online websites, videos and apps on smartphones or TVs make e-learning possible. Sure, this entire e-learning ordeal isn't ideal, but we're in a pandemic mate.

Don't make American problems become Kiwi problems - we have different circumstances with different methods of execution, and it worked to our favour. That's how we got a bit over 20 deaths and the US surpassed over half the lives lost in WW2."
"that's exactly their point tho?? we can't count on herd immunity because we have no evidence for it. they weren't jumping to a conclusion, they were doing the exact opposite. they aren't claiming to be right, they say we shouldn't bet on a possibility we have no evidence for.

"> ypical redditor pushing the “billionaires bad” narrative. Yes, I do want to get back to work and I do want my company to keep making money. The economy is in free fall and business are rapidly closing because the government thought it was a good idea to shut everything down without any kind of exit plan.

I mean, the rest of the world closed things down and didn't have any issue. And businesses are in rapid freefall months after the closedown. Because no one wants to go out and shop at a store when a thousand people are dying every single day.

> You’re missing the “free” part of the idea? How are you so dense? I can leave my house. I can go anywhere. I can do anything. I can meet up with others as much as I want. I can love my life. That’s freedom. The government forcing me to stay in my home is NOT freedom.

I'm definitely still missing the free part. Because being allowed to leave my house isn't being free. Even people in dictatorships can still leave their houses.

But again. Please answer that because you said, ""I can do anything."" What about for the millions of people who do not want to die, but are being forced to die? Where is the freedom for those teachers who have no choice but to go back to a classroom to catch a deadly disease and possibly die? What freedom are they being provided with?

""It is important to note that detection of viral RNA does not equate infectious virus being present and transmissible. """
"yea, but that's kind of what I mean. WHO said that there had been very few known cases.  im just assuming that if asymptomatic transmission was a common occurrence we'd have decent real life data by now.

Might be a poor assumption, since it's probably not easy to trace the cause back to an asymptomatic  person."
"No worries!

It i s scary, eh? It's natural to think the first person caught with it is the first person who caught it, but what if they're 7 people down the chain? Assuming the first link is somebody at the border, that's 6 people who could then spread it in an entirely different direction.

That's a scary though, but if they were earlier in the chain and these 4 people all locked themselves down the moment one person started showing symptoms, it's so much less scary.

Not knowing where it falls in between the two is the stressful part imo. Wish my gut knew whether to be optimistic or pessimistic. I'm ping-ponging back and forth rn."

I can’t imagine how it must feel, sitting at home with nothing but your hobbies and interests, tv, video games, etc to keep busy, and watching some poor schmuck go to work and earn less money because the government deemed them more essential to society than you... I just wonder how people reconcile that with their conscience."
"> Yes, total deaths are higher because we are a larger country.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox

So what that you're a larger country? 

Case-fatality rate is good and all, but it becomes meaningless when you have a substantial greater infection rate than anyone else. Ebola is one of the deadliest viruses when you consider that it has a 50% kill rate, but COVID-19 has killed more people in less than a year than Ebola did in the most recent outbreak that lasted 4 years.

Canada has 9,063 deaths (as of this post) our population is 37 Million. US population is 328 Million. The US has had 163,681 deaths.

Adjusting for population differences (if the US had the same population as Canada but the same current US death rates) then the US would have 18,332 deaths over Canada's 9,063.

The reason I mention Canada is because both countries were in identical positions to react to the pandemic. European countries were hit fast and hard before most of the safety measures were put in place and before there was a true understanding and realization of what was going on.

Canada and US had time to prepare and react. The US is also pretty huge with your population spread out ***WAAAY*** more than in Canada. Something like 98% of the population is within 100km of the Canada-US border (those aren't official numbers, just going from memory). So we are super close to each other. Although the ""useable land"" stats is apparently 4.73% of the entire country. That's land that can be used to farm and sustain the country. The rest of it is arctic tundra and the Canadian shield.

I have friends who have family in the states and the common theme from many down there is that COVID is ""just a big city problem"".

Your case-fatality rate might be ""low"", but I wouldn't be bragging for too long. Unfortunately it seems like we can expect a huge surge in the coming months. I really hope not. I really hope the US (and everyone else) comes out of this whole thing doing ok, but the situation doesn't look like it will."

Roger. I've been using the basic google tracker but this one is WAY cleaner.
"1) I didn't mention WWII's deaths at all. I mentioned the deaths *since* WWII and during WWI as separate numbers. Your skim reading does not equal your being lied to.

2) I said nothing about child hospitalisations, I said we have unusually high child obesity. ""Most children aren't being hospitalised"" means nothing. Most *people* aren't being hospitalised. *Some* of them are. 

3) ""society"" is not being shut down *by* those particularly vulnerable to COVID. It is being shud down by the government with the broad support of the population, as is appropriate in a democracy. I don't see any rights being inappropriately asserted here.

3.1) ""Society"" is being ""shut down"" for three days, conditional on the problem not being worse than it seems,   and if a longer lockdown is instituted it will likely have continued public support.

4) Old people also commonly have medical conditions. Your suggesting that COVID hospitalisations are associated with these does not negate the point about it disproportionately affecting old people. Even if you are not old and have these conditions this does not mean you are expendable for the sake of a few days' or weeks' extra school.

5) locking down the country for a brief period to ensure that the previous four weeks of lockdown were not wasted is a calculated, minimal imposition on the lives of the population to prevent more significant damage from disease, loss of family members, and further bullshit.

Were you never taken out of school for a few days for sick was or a holiday? Or sickness? Did you fail to graduate because you had three sick days in August one year?

Don't answer that shit. You are clearly interested in having a linear argument against the majority decision of a democratic nation and the consensus of its medical personnel, and playing one vulnerable group against others as if the most trivial detriment to one is worse than horrendous damage to the others, on the basis of questionably interpreted statistics and a nebulous idea of universal, implicitly legal, principles which are valued and respected but apparently not unconditionally paramount in the aforementioned country.

Hindsight is 20/20, but this can be said of nearly every country. Countries across the globe send aid to China, at little to no cost. Surprise, surprise, they’re not interested in returning the favor!

> Not antagonize states' governors to get them to prematurely open, which is why we're in the midst of a large spike in the first wave

The difference is our belief of what “premature” means. For many people, I assume one, economic recovery isn’t worth hundreds of thousands of people dying. I disagree with this sentiment, and understand how and why you think that is cruel. I would rather hundreds of thousands of people die (the overwhelming majority of whom only have several years of life left anyway) than see the global economy go in indefinite recession. I believe many people in the administration feel this way, but they will never say it out loud because it’s political suicide. So it just looks entirely bungled, when there’s definitely a rhyme and reason to at least _some_ of the chaos. 

> Not egg on anti-masking covidiots to go out and ""protest"" masks with firearms at state capitol buildings in order to ""liberate"" themselves

In these 6 months you could/should search for a job and you have to pay everything for yourself. You will not be allowed to work in these 6 months. If you find a job in a matter of weeks, you should be able to apply for a work visa so you wouldnt have to wait until the 6 months are over. (I guess it might be easier for you to start working here if you already have had a Visa. But I dunno.)

Since you are a software engineer your job prospects are fine.

The Warehouse also do the cosiest bath robes I think, that super soft navy one they sell is both pretty and warm and unisex. Buy it in the biggest size and hope your fatass ginger cat doesn't sit on it and ruin it with animal hair.

Ooooh and not clothing, but Kmart do a bamboo blend mattress topper that's quite soft and doesn't overheat. I bought a queen size for around $47 (I think) and I stuck it on my pillow top mattress and now every night I fall asleep into clouds.

Ooooh and I saw a blanket at Bed Bath and Beyond that comes with a built in FOOT POCKET (!!!) but I haven't actually tried that one. I would have bought it but I could only find it in single size."

"> Not if those dictatorships are Auckland, NZ or Melbourne, AUS.

I know right? Three whole days they have to stay inside! Their lives have returned to normalcy, with no risk of dying, but those 3 days are HELL. Just the worst thing that has ever happened to them.

> Those teachers in fact are free to catch a “deadly” disease because that’s how diseases are supposed to work! We’ve never been forced to do such take part in such insane responses in any pandemics of the past. But because this is a big, scary coronavirus, (a term most people were not familiar with) crypto-fascist governments have taken advantage of public confusion to drum up fear about the virus.

It's true. All governments across the world have banded together to personal kill their citizens in order to make this virus seem scary.

>I guarantee you that if this pandemic were a flu virus with the exact same method of transmission/cases/symptoms/deaths no one would care. 

Well duh. The flu is 100 times less deadly.

>Why? Take a look at the 2009 swine flu. This killed thousands globally, mostly children, 

No. Mostly old people.

But again, thousands globally while we are very close to hitting the million mark and we are just getting started.

>and actually left long term damage (COVID does not, though the popular reddit narrative would have to think that you will never again be able to function after having COVID) yet, schools did not close. Why? It was just the flu. Coronavirus is a big, scary word and world governments have taken advantage of that.

And this is where we find the issue. You are entirely and utterly uninformed about the virus and it's effects. Despite the dozens of studies that show long term damage from COVID, you are acting like it's not even as bad as the flu. Despite all of the scientific community in agreement that this is a hundred times worse than the flu and that it causes long term damage. Despite the fact that it's already killed more people, you still want to pretend like it's not a big deal.

> Businesses are still in free fall not because people don’t want to go outside, but because of government restrictions. 

Weird. Just ask Disney, who reopened Disney World and found that they don't have the demand to even operate at the reduced capacity...

>Many of these businesses are restricted to 25 or 50 percent capacity, by government order. At that capacity, there is no way for these businesses to be profitable. Also, many people just do not have the money to spend because they are out of employment, again, because of the government’s overreach into business. 

Except, again, no. They would still be unemployed even without the interference. Businesses that have zero restrictions from the government (Such as airlines, which never got impacted in any way) are suffering because no one wants to fly during a pandemic. They shed hundreds of thousands of employees long before any stay at home orders came into effect.


>That’s without even mentioning the pathetic business owners that are staying closed even though they are allowed to reopen. They have fully bought into the media panic porn and refuse to open their businesses. They have taken six months of losses and have destroyed their own livelihoods out of unfounded fear. I have no sympathy for them.

I know you don't. You place zero value on human life, nor do you both to become informed by anything. I understand fully that you do not value human lives, as you've stated many times that 165 thousand dead Americans isn't even a concern to you, and doesn't even register as a problem.

But you've still never addressed the ""freedom"" for the people that do not have any freedom. The people who don't want to die from the virus, that you are signing up to die without a care in the world. The ones being forced to return, especially teachers, who will die from this and don't have any freedom to not die."

"Fine, then compare the US to India. India is a larger country with easily 3x to 4x the population. It's also a fair statement that India doesn't had the same level of healthcare as the US. India was also hit much earlier than the US.

So by your original statement/logic, India should be doing much worse than the US *because* they are a larger country.

Of course there are many factors at play as to why or why not a country is doing well. However, out of just about every country, the US should be doing the best. They had the headstart, the healthcare facilities and infrastructure, etc."
"Sorry you are. You need to get tested to be counted. People haven't been getting tested at a high enough rate. Now combine that with the fact, that Jacinda and Ashley stated, that the family have no links to overseas travel or isolation facilities.

"A lot of concern that I have and most of people around me here have is, well what happens next? The GOP, who enabled this situation, is still there? And what is stoping you from electing another Trump Mk2 in 4-8 years? 

Not so long ago we all thought Bush Jr is as worse as it’s going to get and now here we are. 

In my opinion, I think a lot of Americans do not understand how much influence America lost, how much soft political power got traded away in the last 4 years. Close cooperation with the US and reliance on them  as a political partner, is viewed negatively by any politician who would try to run for office now. 

Even our “right wing” if you want to call them that are distancing themselves from referencing Trump and America, which was not the case in the months before the 2016 election and roughly the first 6-9 months after the election."

But we are willing to go through it and suffer for our employers since we're loyal."
I'm pretty sure I said not in the second sentence. About how we do hour-minute-day-month-year and that doesn't run from smallest to biggest.
"But that's *not* the context. Either you have a misunderstanding of the date system widely used in the USA (we typically use MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY) or you're ignoring the fact that they advocated a date system NOT widely used in the USA (YYYY-MM-DD). Regardless of which it is, I think you're mischaracterizing what you said before. They said, ""YYYY-MM-DD is the easiest to read..."" and you responded, ""...that's because you've been raised with it.""

I think that paraphrasing what they said (and you disagreed with) as ""makes more sense"" is fair. Because what is easiest to read is that which makes intuitive sense. 

Regardless, the bottom line is: 

1. That's not the date system that Americans are raised with; 
2. Thus, familiarity is not why they're advocating for it; 
3. In isolation, it makes every bit as much sense as DD/MM/YYYY; and
4. In conjunction with time conventions, it makes MORE sense than DD/MM/YYYY.

Thus, if you disagree with what he's saying, I think it follows that *your* familiarity with DD/MM/YYYY is what's leading you to disagree with him, nothing else."
